   A recent study investigated acute inflammatory responses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.1 Subjects received 1 mg of heat killed Escherichia coli subcutaneously into each forearm. The magnitude of the ensuing local inflammatory responses, measured as increases in local blood flow, peaked in healthy individuals by 24 hours and resolved within 48 hours. In contrast, the response in two patients with ulcerative colitis was abnormally protracted (supplementary fig 1; supplementary fig 1 can be viewed on the Gut website at http://www.gutjnl.com/supplemental).

One of these patients, a 24 year old female with a 10 year history of left sided ulcerative colitis (confirmed histologically and quiescent on olsalazine 2 g daily), developed severe local complications at both injection sites. Her initial local reaction was macroscopically similar to healthy controls but persisted, progressing to painful erythematous swellings (fig 1A) with vesicobullous formation by day 6 (fig 1B). The patient was otherwise apyrexial and systemically well, with no leucocytosis or gastrointestinal symptoms.

The blisters, 3 cm in diameter, were drained (fig 1C). Aspirated fluid was sterile and contained micromolar concentrations of interleukin 8, levels 1000-fold higher that those reported in skin window1 or blister2 models of acute inflammation. Other cytokines were only minimally elevated; anti-inflammatory interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor β were barely detectable.3 By day 8, two 30×25 mm ulcers with tender, indurated, purple borders had developed at each injection site, appearances highly suggestive of pyoderma gangrenosum. Histological analysis of the ulcer margin revealed dermal abscesses with a neutrophil rich acute inflammatory infiltrate extending into the subcutis (fig 1E), marked oedema, and fibrin exudation. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed a predominance of neutrophils (fig 1F) alongside CD4+ (fig 1G) and CD25− (fig 1H) T lymphocytes, with minimal changes in Langerhans cell, monocyte, and macrophage populations. A 5 mg/kg infusion of infliximab was commenced, which markedly reduced inflammation within 12 hours. The ulcers responded partially to four weeks of clobetasol propionate 0.05% but completely re-epithelialised after two weeks of treatment with topical tacrolimus 0.03% (fig 1D). The patient is currently well.

We subsequently discovered that six years previously this patient had developed a similar extreme reaction to infection of a surgical wound on her foot. This was treated with antibiotics and steroids but eventually required debridement. Conversely, she did not exhibit a generally abnormal response to trauma, as multiple venepunctures and previous tattooing, piercings, and acupuncture healed normally, arguing against classical pathergy.

The abnormally protracted inflammatory response was seen in two patients with ulcerative colitis but not in 13 healthy subjects or 12 patients with Crohn’s disease,1 implicating a hyperinflammatory reaction to E coli in this condition. This might represent an underlying pathological mechanism. The extraordinary severity in this patient could be idiosyncratic or a more general phenomenon in ulcerative colitis. The previous grossly abnormal response to sepsis in her foot favours the former.

Our interpretation of the pathogenesis of these local lesions is that failure to terminate proinflammatory interleukin 8 production led to sustained neutrophil accumulation. Absence of regulatory T cells and minimal anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations3 suggests deficient activation of immunoregulatory mechanisms.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is an ulcerating neutrophilic dermatosis of unknown aetiology. It develops in 5% of inflammatory bowel disease patients and was once considered pathognomonic of ulcerative colitis.4 It is not thought to be infective in origin, and in a minority of cases may be a pathergic reaction to trauma.5 The lesions in this patient resembled pyoderma gangrenosum, suggesting that bacterial products might predispose to its development.

This case is instructive as lesions were induced by E coli in a patient with a chronic inflammatory disease of the large bowel where such organisms are copious. The pathological response to bacteria points to possible mechanisms underlying the inflammatory processes causing ulcerative colitis, as well as its cutaneous manifestation of pyoderma gangrenosum.

(E) Biopsies taken from the margin of the lesion showed granulation tissue, active inflammation in the subcutis, fibrin exudation into the superficial dermis, and pseudoepithelialomatous hyperplasia. High power images (inset) revealed a predominantly neutrophilic leucocyte infiltrate.
