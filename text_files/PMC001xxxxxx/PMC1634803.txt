potential or TRPM subfamily and form Ca2+-permeable
cationic channels activated by intracellular adenosine diphosphoribose (ADPR).
The TRPM2 channel subunit, like all its close relatives, is structurally
homologous to the well-characterized voltage-gated potassium channel subunits,
each containing six transmembrane segments and a putative pore loop between the
fifth and sixth segments. Nevertheless, the structural elements determining the
TRPM2 channel functions are still not well understood. In this study, we
investigated the functional role of two conserved cysteine residues (at
positions 996 and 1008) in the putative pore region of the human TRPM2 by
site-directed mutagenesis combined with electrophysiological and biochemical
approaches. Expression of wild type hTRPM2 channels in HEK293 cells resulted in
robust ADPR-evoked currents. Substitution of cysteine with alanine or serine
generated mutant channels that failed to be activated by ADPR. Furthermore,
experiments by Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, biotin labelling, and
co-immunoprecipitation techniques showed no obvious changes in protein
expression, trafficking or membrane localisation, and the ability of interacting
with neighbouring subunits that is required for channel assembly. Co-expression
of wild type and mutant subunits significantly reduced the ADPR-evoked currents;
for combination of wild type and C996S mutant subunits, the reduction was
approximately 95%, indicating that incorporation of one or more
non-functional C996S subunits leads to the loss of channel function. These
results taken together suggest that the cysteine residues in the pore region are
obligatory for TRPM2 channel function.

   Introduction
Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a very large family of
integral membrane proteins, which form cationic channels with diverse profiles with
regard to their mechanisms of activation, electrophysiological and biophysical
properties, and physiological functions (3,
4, 22, 28). Based on structural
relatedness, mammalian TRP proteins have been categorised into six subfamilies: TRPC
(canonical), TRPV (vanilloid receptor-related), TRPM (melastatin-related), TRPP
(polycystin-related), TRPML (mucolipin-like), and TRPA (ankyrin) (3, 4, 9, 21,
22). TRPM2, formerly known as TRPC7
(24) or LTRPC2 (27), forms Ca2+-permeable cationic
channels that are specifically activated by intracellular adenosine diphosphoribose
(ADPR) (27, 32). A number of factors including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide,
H2O2, cyclic ADPR and intracellular
Ca2+ have been reported to activate TRPM2 channels
independently of or synergistically with ADPR (8, 10, 17, 20, 32, 34).
TRPM2 mRNA is highly expressed in the brain and also detected in many other tissues
including the heart, placenta, lung, kidney, spleen and ovary (27, 33). TRPM2 or
TRPM2-like functional responses have been documented in striatal neurons (12), U973 monocyte and Jurkat cells (27, 32),
neutrophil (10), insulinoma cells (8, 13)
and microglia (18). ADPR and other endogenous
activators or synergising ligands and TRPM2 channels are thought to represent an
intrinsic mechanism of providing Ca2+ entry into cells and
regulating cellular functions (32) or causing
cell death by disrupting cellular homeostasis in response to changes in cellular
redox states (8).

TRPM2 proteins comprise an ion channel core domain and cytoplasmic N- and C-
termini (Fig. 1). While no specific functional
roles have been designated for the N-terminus (residues 1–761 in
hTRPM2), a major distal part (residues 1236–1503; termed NUTD9-H domain)
of the C-terminus which encompasses residues 1049–1503, is homologous to
the NUTD9 proteins, ADPR pyrophosphatases belonging to the nudix hydrolase family,
and contains the binding site for ADPR (19,
27). The ion channel domain (residues
762–1048) is composed of six transmembrane (6TM) segments (S1-S6) and a
pore loop between the S5 and S6, similar to the voltage-gated potassium channels and
other six 6TM channels including cyclic nucleotide gated channels. Nevertheless,
sequence analysis of these closely related channels or even for the TRP channel
family members has led to the identification of sequence differences as well as
sequence homology. The functional implications remain yet to be established.
Sequence alignment of the pore regions of the TRP superfamily indicates that, unlike
their close relatives of the TRPC and TRPV subfamilies, all the members of the TRPM
subfamily contain a pair of cysteine residues (positions 996 and 1008 in the human
TRPM2 subunit) of which the first is completely conserved within the TRPM subfamily
and the second is present at slightly different positions (Fig. 1). In this study, we combined site-directed
mutagenesis with biochemical and electrophysiological approaches to investigate the
potential role of these conserved cysteine residues in the TRPM2 channel function.
Substitution of cysteine with either alanine or serine generated mutant channels
which were functionally unresponsive to ADPR. Furthermore, biochemical experiments
showed that loss of the channel function was not due to effects on protein
expression, membrane trafficking or localisation. The mutant subunits also showed
normal interaction with neighbouring subunits. However, co-expression of wild type
with mutant subunits markedly reduced the ADPR-evoked currents. These results taken
together suggest an obligatory role in channel function of cysteine residues in the
pore region of TRPM2.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals, constructs, cell culture and transfection
All the chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise
specified. The cDNA encoding the human TRPM2 protein with an N-terminal FLAG tag
was a kind gift from AM Scharenberg (Washington University, Seattle, USA). The
plasmid encoding the hTRPM2 subunit with a C-terminal EE tag was constructed as
follows. The hTRPM2 and tag sequences were amplified by PCR using the following
pair of primers: 5′-ATG GAG CCC TCA GCC CTG AGG AAA
GC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CTA TTC CAT TGG CAT GTA
TTC GTA GTG AGC CCC GAA CTC AG-3′ (reverse primer). The PCR amplicon
was inserted into the vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and the fragment between
HindIII and EcoRV was excised and
subcloned into pcDNA 3.1/myc-His vector (Invitrogen) between
HindIII and PmeI sites. The coding
sequences were verified by sequencing. Both FLAG-tagged and EE-tagged constructs
were used in this study, and no noticeable differences were seen in their
functional properties and therefore data where appropriate were pooled. Point
mutations were introduced in the EE-tagged hTRPM2 construct using the QuikChange
site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing.

Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were used in this study to express
wild type and mutant TRPM2 proteins. Cells were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine
and 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen)
at 37ºC under 5% CO2 humidified conditions.
Transient transfection of HEK293 cells with plasmids was carried out using
lipofectamin2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Electrophysiological recordings
Cells were grown in 35 mm petri-dishes and transfected with 1
μg hTRPM2 plasmid (and 0.1 μg green fluorescent protein
(GFP) plasmid). Transfected cells were seeded on glass cover-slips
12–24 hr after transfection and used in the following
24–72 hr. Whole cell recordings were made at room temperature using
an Axopatch 200B amplifier and analysed using pCLAMP9 software (Axon
Instruments). Patch electrodes with a resistance of 4–6
MΩ were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (World
Precision Instruments). Cells were held at −40 mV and voltage ramps
from −120 mV to 80 mV with 1 s duration were applied every 5 or 10
s. Extracellular solutions contained: 147 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM
MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES and 13 mM glucose
(Na+ solution), or 149 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM
CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES and 13 mM glucose (K+ solution),
or 110 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES and 13 mM glucose (K+
solution). Intracellular solution contained 147 mM NaCl, 50 μM EDTA,
1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, and 1 mM Na2ATP. All the
solutions were maintained pH7.3 with NaOH and 300–315 mosm/l. ADPR
stock solution (100 mM) was made in intracellular solution, kept at
−20°C in aliquots, and diluted to the indicated
concentrations in intracellular solution prior to use. Flufenamic acid (FFA) was
freshly made as a 1 M stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted in
extracellular solution to a final concentration of 0.5 mM prior to application;
there was no detectable effect of DMSO as previously reported (11). FFA was applied for 0.5–1 min via a
rapid solution changer RSC-160 (Biologic Science Instruments, France). All the
data were presented as mean ± SEM, and statistical analysis was
carried out using Student’s t test where
appropriately.

Immunocytochemistry
Cells were prepared as described above for electrophysiological
recordings without addition of GFP plasmid in the transfection.
Immunocytochemistry was performed using protocols previously detailed (30). Briefly, we used mouse monoclonal
anti-EE primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution; Babco, Richard, USA), and a
FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:200 dilution, Sigma).

Co-immunoprecipitation, biotinylation and Western blotting
Cells were prepared in T25 flasks (~3 x 106 cells) and
transfected with 3 μg plasmid as described above. For each flask,
cells were collected into 1 ml chilled phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 24 hr
after transfection. For co-immunoprecipiation experiments, cells were pelleted
at 4°C by centrifugation and lysed at 4°C for 30 min in
200 μl lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2
mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol supplemented with
a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche). After clearing by centrifugation at
4ºC for 10 min, the supernatant was mixed with 20 μl
pre-equilibrated Ezview red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel beads and agitated at
4ºC for 2 hr. The beads were collected by centrifugation at
8200×g for 30 s, kept on ice after removing the
supernatant, and washed three times, each time by suspending in 1 ml lysis
buffer and centrifuging at 8200×g for 30 s. After
the final wash, the immunoprecipitated samples (beads) were re-suspended in 40
μl electrophoresis sample buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8,
2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mM DTT,
0.05% bromophenol blue, boiled for 5 min and centrifuged at
8200×g for 30 s.

For biotin labelling experiments, HEK293 cells were washed 3 times with
PBS 24 hr after transfection and incubated in 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce)
for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were then washed three times in PBS
containing 50 mM glycine, and lysed with lysis buffer (see above) for 30 min at
4°C. Biotin-conjugated cell surface proteins were purified with
streptavidin-agarose. Affinity-purified protein complexes were denaturated as
described above for co-immunoprecipitation protein samples.

Western blotting was performed at room temperature. Protein samples were
resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitro-cellular
membranes under semi-dry transfer conditions (Biorad) for 1 hr (constant
current, 1 mA/cm2 membrane). After blocking for 1 hr with
5% non-fat milk made in TBST solution (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20), the membranes were incubated for 1 hr with
primary rabbit anti-EE antibody (1:2000 dilution; Bethyl, Texas, USA), and
washed three times in TBST solution for 5 min. The membranes were then incubated
for 50 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody
(1:2000 dilution; Santa Cruz), and washed three times in TBST solution as
before. Proteins were visualized using supersignal west pico chemiluminescent
substrates according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Pierce) and
captured on X-ray films.

Results
Functional expression and properties of wild type hTRPM2 channel
Whole cell current recordings were carried out, following transient
transfection of HEK293 cells with TRPM2 cDNA, to confirm functional channel
expression. Our preliminary experiments showed that the time course and the
amplitude of the current responses were ADPR concentration-dependent which is
consistent with previous reports (17,
27). Thus, a supermaximal
concentration of ADPR (1 mM) was used throughout this study in order to obtain
maximal functional responses. Fig. 2A shows
the current responses of a cell expressing wild type TRPM2 channels to voltage
ramps from −120 mV to 80 mV (left panel), and plots the current
amplitudes at membrane potentials of −80 mV and +80 mV
(right panel). Upon breaking into whole-cell configuration, large currents
appeared which reached a maximal level within 10 s. Currents exhibited typical
linear current-voltage (I/V) relationships (Fig.
2B) with a reversible potential close to zero (−1.3
± 0.2 mV, n = 5), indicating that they were elicited by
non-selective cationic channels. The currents varied from approximately 0.5 nA
to more than 10 nA with a mean peak current amplitude of 5.0 ± 0.6
nA (n = 18) at a membrane potential of −80 mV. Such
robust currents were never detected either in the TRPM2 channel expressing cells
when recording using intracellular solution without ADPR (left panel in Fig. 2C) or in the non-transfected cells
using intracellular solution containing ADPR (Fig.
3B). To further confirm that the ADPR-evoked currents were mediated
by the TRPM2 channels, we tested flufenamic acid, a TRPM2 channel antagonist
(11), and also the sensitivity to
calcium (20). As illustrated in Fig. 2B, flufenamic acid (0.5 mM) rapidly and
almost completely inhibited the ADPR-evoked currents (middle panel in Fig. 2C). The inhibition was independent of
the membrane potential and irreversible during washing for 5 min (Fig. 2B). Upon changing extracellular solution
containing no calcium (replaced with an equal molar concentration of barium) to
extracellular solution containing 2 mM calcium, the ADPR-evoked currents were
remarkably increased (right panel in Fig.
2C). These results clearly indicate that the ADPR-evoked currents are the
result of activation of functionally expressed TRPM2 channels and confirm that
the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties observed here are
similar to those reported by other groups (11, 17, 20, 27).

Effects of mutating C996 and C1008 on current responses to ADPR
To explore the potential functional role of cysteine residues at
positions 996 and 1008 in the pore region, we firstly replaced these amino acid
residues individually with alanine. In contrast to the robust ADPR-evoked
currents observed following expression of the wild type channels, cells
expressing either C996A or C1008A mutant channels failed to respond to ADPR
(Fig. 3B). We then introduced serine
substitutions, because we reasoned that this manipulation would produce the
smallest structural alteration, in that it changed an SH- for an OH- group.
Surprisingly, ADPR also either failed to elicit currents or only evoked very
small currents in cells expressing these mutant channels (Fig. 3A and Fig.3B).

Whole-cell currents were also recorded from cells expressing wild type,
C996S or C1008S mutant channels in extracellular solutions containing
K+ or Ca2+ as the major
cations. In extracellular K+ and
Ca2+ solutions, ADPR elicited substantial currents in
cells expressing wild type channels, but no current or very small currents in
cells expressing C996S or C1008S mutant channels (Fig.3C). To rule out the possibility that loss of channel function
was due to a non-specific mutational effect, we substituted alanine into a
non-conserved glutamic acid residue (E994), one residue away from C996 (Fig.1). Expression of the E994A mutant
channels, like the wild type channels, gave rise to robust ADPR-evoked currents
(−6.1 ± 1.3 nA, n = 5), which were blocked
by FFA (98.0 ± 1.3%, n = 5).

Effects on protein expression and membrane localisation
The loss of channel function as a result of mutating these cysteine
residues could be attributed to mutational defects in either protein expression
or protein trafficking or both. To investigate these possibilities, we performed
Western blotting, immunostaining and biotin labelling experiments. Fig.4 shows the representative results.
Clearly, there was no obvious difference in the expression levels of wild type
or mutant subunit proteins (C996A, C996S, C1008A and C1008S) (Fig.4A). Furthermore, immunoreactivity for wild type,
C996S and C1008S mutant subunits was similar, showing dominant clustering around
the plasma membrane (Fig.4B). In addition,
the biotin labelling experiments indicate that the levels of biotinylated TRPM2
protein at the plasma membrane were not greatly changed for wild type and mutant
subunits (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these
results suggest that the mutation of C996 or C1008 did not significantly alter
the protein expression, the trafficking of the protein, or the membrane
localisation and therefore does not account for the loss of channel
activity.

Co-expression of mutant subunits with wild type subunit
TRPM2 channels are thought to form as tetramers, in analogy to
voltage-gated potassium and other 6TM channels. The introduction of mutations in
individual subunits could impair the subunit interactions which are required for
the formation of functional channel complexes. To address this possibility, we
co-expressed EE-tagged wild type, C996S or C1008S subunits with FLAG-tagged wild
type subunits, and performed co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig.5A, co-expression did not change the expression
levels of either the EE-tagged wild type, C996S or C1008S mutant subunit
proteins (top panel) or the FLAG-tagged wild type subunit proteins (middle
panel). The amount of EE-tagged wild type, C998S and C1008S mutant subunit
proteins, pulled down with the co-expressed FLAG-tagged wild type subunit
proteins using an anti-FLAG antibody, was similar (bottom panel). Similar
results were also seen in reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments using an
anti-EE antibody (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that
C996S and C1008S mutant subunits interact with neighbouring wild type subunits
to the same extent as wild type subunits interact with each other.

We next examined the functional effects of C996S and C1008S mutant
subunits by recording the ADPR-evoked currents from cells expressing wild type
subunit alone, wild type subunit co-expressed with C996S subunit, or wild type
subunit co-expressed with C1008S subunit. Fig.5 shows examples current recordings. A significant reduction in
ADPR-evoked current amplitude was observed when wild type subunit was
co-expressed with either C996S or C1008S mutant subunit. The mean amplitude of
ADPR-evoked peak currents was 0.3 ± 0.06 nA (n = 8) from
cells co-expressing wild type and C996S subunits, 1.2 ± 0.2 nA (n
= 11) from cells co-expressing wild type and C1008S subunits and 4.7
± 0.5 nA (n = 13) from cells expressing wild type
subunit alone (Fig.5). The average
ADPR-evoked currents were reduced by 94% and 75% as a
result of co-expression of wild type subunit with C996S mutant subunit, and
co-expression of wild type subunit with C1008S mutant subunit, respectively.

Discussion
The main finding from this study, which combines site-directed mutagenesis
with biochemical and electrophysiological approaches, is that the conserved cysteine
residues in the pore region are obligatory for normal TRPM2 channel function.

Transient receptor potential or TRP channels, in terms of the membrane
spanning or channel core domains (Fig.1), are
homologous to the voltage-gated potassium channels and other 6TM channels. However
careful amino acid sequence analysis of, for example, the pore regions of these
closely related channels or even for the TRP channel family members, led to the
identification of sequence differences as well sequence homology. Our present
understanding of the functional implications is still poor, but starts to emerge.
For example, the majority of TRPM channels (TRPM1–3, 6–8)
are permeable to Ca2+, whereas the TRPM4 and TRPM5 channels
are not. This striking difference in ion permeability was elegantly underpinned to a
set of specific amino acid residues in the pore region by Nilius and colleagues
(25). In the present study, we
investigated two cysteine residues in the pore region; the first one is completely
conserved in the TRPM subfamily and the second is present at slightly different
positions (Fig.1). Substitution of either of
them with alanine led to complete loss of the channel function (Fig.3). These positions were not able to tolerate any
structural modifications, since substitution with serine, which only replaces the
SH- group in the side chain with an OH- group, still blunted channel function (Fig.3). In contrast to C996 and C1008, mutation
of a nonconserved residue (E994) gave rise to normal functional channels, indicating
that the loss of function for the cysteine mutants examined here is not simply due
to non-specific mutational effects.

TRPM2 are cationic channels that are permeable to
Na+, K+ and
Ca2+. Considering that C996 and C1008 are located in the pore
region, mutations of pore residues could potentially alter the ion selectivity as
has already been shown for the TRPM4 and TRPV6 channels (25). However whole-cell recordings show that cells
expressing C996S and C1008S subunits in extracellular solutions containing
Na+, K+ or
Ca2+ as the major ion species all failed to produce
significant ADPR-evoked currents, in contrast to cells expressing wild type subunit
(Fig.3B and C). This largely rules out that
the possibility that loss of channel function was due to altered ion permeation
properties of the channel.

Loss of ion channel function could however be attributed to changes in
protein expression or protein trafficking, e.g., KATP channels (1, 26)
and P2X receptors (2). Alternatively, it may
also be due to changes in the ability of the subunits to interact to form
multiple-subunit complexes, as previously shown for cyclic nucleotide gated-channels
(36),
Ca2+-activated potassium channels (16) and chloride channels (31). However, our Western blotting, immunostaining and
biotin labelling experiments show that the mutant TRPM2 protein expression levels
and membrane localisation were very similar to those of the wild type subunit (Fig.4). Furthermore, the co-immunoprecipitation
experiments indicate that there were no detrimental effects on the ability of the
subunits to interact as a result of mutating these cysteine residues (Fig.5A). Whole-cell current recordings from cells
co-expressing mutant and wild type subunits demonstrate that co-expression of mutant
subunits dramatically reduced the ADPR-evoked currents (Fig.5B). These electrophysiological results not only
indicate that the wild type and mutant subunits do interact to form
“heteromeric” channels, but also provide further functional
evidence to support the importance of these cysteine residues in TRPM2 channel
function.

TRPM2 channels, like any other ligand-gated ion channels, in the simplest
model are activated in two major steps, that is, agonist binding and channel gating
(conformational changes elicited by agonist binding that lead to channel opening).
For TRPM2 channels, the agonist ADPR has been shown to bind to the intracellular
C-terminal NUDT9-H domain (19, 27), which is physically distant from the pore
region (Fig.1). Thus, it is unlikely that these
cysteine residues contribute to ADPR binding. One possibility is that they may be
involved in the conformational changes that occur during channel gating. However, as
the cysteine SH- group is essential for channel function, an alternative
interpretation is that these residues could form disulfide bonds to maintain the
tertiary structure and/or conformation of the channel complex. Experiments showed
that ADPR-evoked currents were not affected by application of dithiothreitol (DTT),
a reducing reagent, or 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate, a
cysteine-specific modifying reagent (data not shown). Similar observations using
these modifying reagents have previously been seen for instance in the ATP-gated P2X
receptors, which contain ten conserved cysteine residues on the extracellular domain
(14, 15). However, subsequent studies using site-directed mutagenesis revealed
that these conserved cysteines in the P2X receptor are structurally important in
maintaining receptor function (5, 7). Further studies are required to determine
whether these cysteine residues play a role in the channel gating and/or they
contribute to the structural stability of the channel.

Co-expression of TRPM2 wild type and cysteine mutant subunits resulted in a
significant suppression of the ADPR-evoked currents, and in particular the effect
resulting from co-expression with C996S mutant subunit is striking. The difference
in the functional effects seen between C996S and C1008S mutant subunits might be due
to that C996 is completely conserved and may occupy a position that is structurally
and/or functionally more critical than C1008. This study demonstrates that mutant
subunits exhibit normal protein expression, membrane trafficking and subunit
interactions, thus it is reasonable to assume that incorporation of wild type and
mutant subunits into tetrameric channels is binomial. In such a scenario, the
suppression of channel function observed with co-expression of wild type and C996S
mutant subunits suggests that channels containing one or more C996S subunits are not
functional. TRPM2 mRNA is abundantly expressed in the brain. Functional TRPM2 or
TRPM2-like channels have also been observed in neurons and many other cells types
(see introduction). A major obstacle in studying the physiological functions of
TRPM2 channels is the lack of specific antagonists. The strong functional
suppression by the C996S mutant subunit, regardless of the underlying mechanisms,
could be feasibly explored as a useful tool to probe the physiological roles of
TRPM2 channels in native cellular milieu as have been demonstrated in many previous
studies (e.g., 6, 23, 29, 34, 35).

In summary, this study has combined site-directed mutagenesis, biochemical
and electrophysiological approaches to provide evidence to support that two cysteine
residues in the pore region are obligatory for normal TRPM2 channel function. Both
cysteine residues are present in all the other TRPM subfamily members and in
particular C996 is completely conserved, and thus the present findings contribute to
our evolving understanding of the structure and function of the TRPM channels.

Figure 3 Mutations of cysteine residues result in loss of channel function
A: Currents at a membrane potential of −80 mV from cells
expressing TRPM2 wild type (left panel) or C996S mutant
channels (right panel) using voltage ramps as described in
Fig. 2A. The arrows indicate the
first current recorded in the whole-cell configuration and the grey bars
show the duration of application of flufenamic acid (FFA). B: Summary of
mean peak currents recorded from non-transfected HEK293 cells (HEK), and
cells expressing EE-tagged TRPM2 wild type (WT), C996A, C996S, C1008A or
C1008S mutant channels. *** p &lt;
0.0001 indicates a significant difference in the current amplitude of wild
type channels compared to mutants (C996A, C996S, C1008A or C1008S) channels
and non-transfected cells. C: Mean currents from cells expressing wild type,
C996S or C1008S mutant channels in extracellular solutions containing 149 mM
KCl or 110 mM CaCl2. ** p &lt; 0.005

Figure 4 Loss of function for mutant TRPM2 are not due to defects in expression
and membrane localisation
A: Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates from non-transfected HEK293
(HEK) cells and HEK293 cells expressing EE-tagged TRPM2 wild type, C996A,
C996S, C1008A and C1008S mutant subunits using an anti-EE antibody. B:
Immunostaining of non-transfected HEK293 cells, and HEK293 cells expressing
EE-tagged TRPM2 wild type, C996S or C1008S mutant subunits using anti-EE
antibody. Note that there was no detectable immunostaining in
non-transfected HEK cells and that the immunoreactivity in cells expressing
TRPM2 wild type or mutant subunits were dominantly clustered around the
plasma membrane. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in
immunoreactivity between wild type and mutant subunits. C. Western blot
analysis of whole cell lysates (top panel) and biotin
labelled membrane proteins (bottom panel) from cells
expressing EE-tagged TRPM2 wild type, C996S and C1008S mutant subunits using
anti-EE antibody. Similar results were observed in at least two independent
experiments.

Figure 5 Mutant TRPM2 subunits when co-expressed with wild type subunit show
normal subunit interaction but significantly reduced channel function
A: Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates (top panel)
using an anti-EE antibody. Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody
(middle panel) or using anti-EE antibody
(bottom panel) of immunoprecipitated proteins pulled
down using anti-FLAG antibody. Cells were transfected with plasmids for the
pairs of wild type or mutant subunits indicated above. Similar results were
seen in two independent experiments. B: Current responses were recorded
every 5 s from cells transfected with EE-tagged wild type (top
left), EE-tagged wild type and C996S mutant subunits (top
right), or EE-tagged wild type and C1008S mutant subunits
(bottom left). Insets show the I/V relationship curves
before (point 1) and after (point 2) inhibition by FFA. The results from all
the experiments are summarized as mean data (bottom right)
