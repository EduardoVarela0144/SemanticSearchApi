Protected oligonucleotides containing a 2′-O-carboxymethyl group were obtained by use of a novel uridine 3′-phosphoramidite, where the carboxylic acid moiety was introduced as its allyl ester. This protecting group is stable to the conditions used in solid-phase oligonucleotide assembly, but easily removed by Pd(0) and morpholine treatment. 2′-O-Carboxymethylated oligonucleotides were then efficiently conjugated on a solid support under normal peptide coupling conditions to various amines or to the N-termini of small peptides to give products of high purity in good yield. The method is well suited in principle for the preparation of peptide–oligonucleotide conjugates containing an amide linkage between the 2′-position of an oligonucleotide and the N-terminus of a peptide.

   Introduction
There are many methodologies available for preparing natural oligonucleotides, as well as their analogues containing modified phosphate groups, nucleobases and sugars.1 The advances in solid-phase synthesis inspired various strategies for preparation of oligonucleotide conjugates.2,3 Oligonucleotide conjugation is predominantly carried out by use of a nucleophilic group on an oligonucleotide to react with an electrophilic group on a tag or a solid support. This strategy still predominates because the common oligonucleotide deprotection is performed by base treatment e.g. ammonia or methylamine which are inherently nucleophilic. Indeed, there are many methods of preparation of oligonucleotides modified with amino or thiol groups at a variety of positions.1 On the other hand, there are many situations when researchers wish to introduce an electrophilic group into oligonucleotides. 4 In this vein, we developed a phosphoramidite incorporating a carboxylic acid function protected by a 2-chlorotrityl group.5a The reagent is suitable for solid-phase synthesis of 5′-carboxylated oligonucleotides that may be conjugated to various amines on solid supports after activation by a suitable peptide coupling reagent.5 The monomer is now commercially available.5b Similarly, 5′-carboxy-modifier C10 is sold by Glen Research that contains a preformed carboxylic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and can be used directly in solid-phase conjugation.6

In previous work in this field we7 and others8,9 described syntheses of 2′-O-7,8 or 2′-S-carboxymethyloligonucleotides,9 where an alkyl ester was chosen as a carboxylic acid protecting group. After completion of solid-phase oligonucleotide assembly, support-bound oligonucleotides containing methyl7,8b or ethyl8a ester were hydrolysed by treating with aq. NaOH or treated by an appropriate amine to afford either the carboxymethyl group or the corresponding amides, respectively, after final deprotection. As a result, these methods are frequently plagued by low yields, long reaction times, the need for large excesses of reactant(s), and the formation of by-products that are difficult to separate.

Recently, we reported our preliminary studies10,11 that show that oligonucleotides containing a 2′-carboxymethyl group can be conjugated to amines, amino acid derivatives and small peptides by amide bond formation on solid phase under peptide coupling conditions or in aqueous media by a water-soluble carbodiimide-mediated reaction.

We would like to report here the synthesis of the 2′-O-carboxymethylated oligonucleotides by use of a uridine 3′-phosphoramidite, where the carboxylic acid function carries an allyl protecting group, which is readily removed under mild and specific conditions of Pd(0)-catalysis. Subsequent conjugation of the 2′-carboxylic acid to a range of primary aliphatic and aromatic amines and peptides is achieved by peptide coupling reagent-promoted amide bond formation on a solid support. We demonstrate examples of the synthesis of 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides containing a 2′-O-carboxymethyl group and their conjugation to a range of amines and peptides.

Results and discussion
The route to the 2′-O-(allyloxycarbonyl)methyluridine building block 6 is illustrated in Scheme 1. The starting 3′,5′-O-(tetraisopropyldisiloxan-1,3-diyl)uridine 1 was obtained from uridine as reported previously12,13 and purified by column chromatography on silica gel in CHCl3–EtOAc (9:1, then 2:1 v/v). Protection of the N3 of uracil is required, since the subsequent alkylation of 3′,5′-O-protected uridine preferentially occurs at the base moiety. To protect the imido function from this side reaction, we chose to block the N3-position with an ammonia-labile pivaloyloxymethyl (Pom) group. The group also prevents undesirable side reactions during oligonucleotide assembly. Furthermore, the greater lipophilicity of the Pom derivative is helpful for chromatographic separation of the target compound. Initially, Pom was reported as a protecting group for the lactam function of a uracil moiety.14 This group was introduced by the transient protection procedure, which involved 2′-O-trimethylsilylation followed by N3-protection.14b On the other hand, Sekine15 showed earlier that various N3-protected uridine derivatives may be obtained selectively in the presence of an unprotected 2′-OH group under conditions of phase-transfer catalysis. These results led us to consider a phase-transfer reaction to convert 1 into 2. Indeed, when 1 was allowed to react with 10 equiv. of chloromethyl pivalate in a biphasic system 0.2 M Na2CO3–CH2Cl2 (2:1 v/v) in the presence of 0.2 equiv. of tetra-n-butylammonium hydrogen sulfate (TBAHS) as a phase-transfer catalyst at room temperature for 48 h under vigorous stirring, N3-pivaloyloxymethyl-3′,5′-O-(tetraisopropyldisiloxan-1,3-diyl)uridine 2 was isolated in 70% yield after column chromatography. General methods of 2′-O-alkylation of ribonucleosides have been reviewed by Zatsepin et al.16 We previously adopted a convenient procedure7 for 2′-O-alkylation by use of a strong sterically hindered organic base 2-tert-butylimino-2-diethylamino-1,3-dimethylperhydro-1,3,2-diazaphosphorine (BEMP) described in a number of publications.17,18 Later we replaced BEMP by another phosphazene base P1-tert-butyltris(tetramethylene) (BTPP), which is cheaper and even more basic, though less sterically hindered than BEMP.19 Thus, we found that alkylation of compound 2 with 2.5 equiv. of allyl chloroacetate and 2.8 equiv. of BTPP gave 3 in 90% yield after 3–5 h. Compound 3 was then desilylated smoothly with TBAF7 or, better, triethylamine trihydrofluoride13 in THF and then converted into the 5′-O-dimethoxytrityl (DMTr) derivative 5 by the known procedure.20 Subsequent phosphitylation of the 3′-hydroxy group in an inert atmosphere using bis(N,N-diisopropylamino)-2-cyanoethoxyphosphine in CH2Cl2 in the presence of diisopropylammonium tetrazolide21 afforded the phosphoramidite 6. This was used successfully in machine-assisted solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis. The average coupling efficiency of 6 at a 0.2 M concentration in dry MeCN and 30 min reaction time was found to be greater than 97%. The modified phosphoramidite was utilised in the synthesis of two 2′-O-methyloligoribonucleotides I and II (Table 1). Decamer I was synthesised as a model to select and optimise the specific conditions of deblocking, purification and conjugation. Oligonucleotide II is complementary to the HIV-1 TAR RNA apical stem-loop, the binding site for the HIV-1 trans-activator protein Tat.22

To remove the 2′-allyl protecting group on the solid phase, we used a mixture of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), triphenylphosphine and morpholine7 in dry CH2Cl2 for 50 min (Scheme 2). During the procedure, other protecting groups remain intact and the oligonucleotide is still linked to a polymer support.23

Further conjugations of 2′-O-carboxymethylated oligonucleotides I and II were carried out on solid phase in organic solvent (Scheme 2). The choice of amine was influenced by the expected application for the conjugate e.g. introduction of positive charge(s) or nucleophilic amino groups (N,N,N-tris( aminoethyl)amine 7, histamine 10, spermine 11 and N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(3-aminopropyl)-1,4-butanediamine 12), chemoselective ligation (3-amino-1,2-propanediol 9)22 or fluorescent labeling (1-aminopyrene 13 and 1-pyrenemethylamine 1413). In the case of spermine that contains both primary and secondary amino groups, we expected selective reaction with a primary amino group facilitated by the excess of amine.5a For further conjugation experiments, we have chosen several amino acid derivatives 15 and 16 and short peptides 17–20 and FMRF amide-related peptide 21 demonstrated to be cardioactive neuropeptide. 24 To prevent the formation of byproducts both amino acids and peptides were utilised as C-terminal amides. To obtain a high yield of structurally diverse types of conjugates (Table 1) we used pre-activation of polymer-bound 2′-O-carboxymethyloligonucleotide with TBTU–HOBT (1:1) at 37 °C in dry DMF for 40 min, followed by addition of the amine, amino acid or peptide and further incubation.25 Reaction times for the amines differed significantly from those for the amino acids and peptides. Whilst all amines reacted within 3 h, amino acids and peptides required overnight reaction. After completion of the reaction, polymer-bound conjugates were cleaved from their solid supports and deprotected by concentrated aqueous ammonia treatment at 55 °C overnight. Reaction mixtures obtained were analysed by reversed-phase HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS. Only a single product was observed in the case of spermine conjugate I.11. Examples of typical RP-HPLC traces are shown in Fig. 1. Noteworthy, the two unprotected arginine residues in peptide 21 did not interfere with its successful conjugation at the N-terminus. We ascribe this to the presence of an excess of HOBt that may protonate the guanidino group of arginine and thus protect it from acylation.

In conclusion, we have described an efficient and reliable method for preparation of 2′-O-carboxymethyloligonucleotides using protected uridine 3′-phosphoramidite containing a 2′-carboxymethyl group protected as an allyl ester. After deprotection under conditions of Pd(0) catalysis, such modified oligonucleotides may be conjugated, while still attached to a solid support, to a range of primary or secondary aliphatic or aromatic amines or to the N-termini of short peptides. The method described could prove useful in synthesis of small molecule libraries of oligonucleotide conjugates for diagnostic or therapeutic evaluation. In addition, this conjugation method may be a useful route for attachment of membrane-penetrating peptides, particularly those containing multiple arginine residues, to the 2′-position of oligonucleotides and their analogues for cellular uptake studies.

Oligonucleotide synthesis
2′-O-Methyloligoribonucleotides were assembled on an ABI 394B DNA Synthesizer by the phosphoramidite method according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Protected 2′-O-methylribonucleoside phosphoramidites and S-ethylthiotetrazole were purchased from Glen Research (via Cambio). Prepacked 0.4 μmol functionalised columns of controlled pore glass (Glen Research) were used throughout. For couplings with modified phosphoramidite 6, 0.2 M concentration in dry MeCN was used, and the coupling time was increased to 30 min.

Deprotection of carboxylic acid function of oligonucleotides I, II

Reaction mixtures were analysed by RPHPLC, conjugates were purified by RP-HPLC on a Gilson HPLC system using a Beckman Ultrasphere ODS column (4.6 × 250 mm) and dual wavelength detection (215 and 254 nm); buffer A: 5% of MeCN (v/v) in 0.1 M triethylammonium acetate, buffer B: MeCN; flow rate 1 cm3 min−1, gradient of B in A: 0–5%, 5 min, 5–15%, 10 min, 15–40, 30 min, 40–80%, 10 min, 80–0%, 10 min. Combined fractions containing the conjugate were evaporated, redissolved and precipitated by 4 M sodium acetate solution (0.2 cm3) and ethanol (1.5 cm3) or 2 M LiClO4 (0.2 cm3) and acetone (1.5 cm3). Molecular masses of purified conjugates were then checked by MALDI-TOF MS.
