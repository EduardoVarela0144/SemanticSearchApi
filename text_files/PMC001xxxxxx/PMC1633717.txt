A modification to the 3D modified driven equilibrium Fourier transform
                    (MDEFT) imaging technique is proposed that reduces its sensitivity to RF
                    inhomogeneity. This is especially important at high field strengths where RF
                    focusing effects exacerbate B1 inhomogeneity,
                    causing significant signal nonuniformity in the images. The adiabatic inversion
                    pulse used during the preparation period of the MDEFT sequence is replaced by a
                    hard (nonadiabatic) pulse with a nominal flip angle of 130°. The
                    spatial inhomogeneity of the hard pulse preparation compensates for the
                    inhomogeneity of the excitation pulses. Uniform signal intensity is obtained for
                    a wide range of B1 amplitudes and the high CNR
                    characteristic of MDEFT is retained. The new approach was validated by numerical
                    simulations and successfully applied to human brain imaging at 4.7 T, resulting
                    in highquality T1-weighted images of the whole human
                    brain at high field strength with uniform signal intensity and contrast, despite
                    the presence of significant RF inhomogeneity.

The use of high field strength MR systems for imaging the human brain has
                become increasingly widespread over recent years. High field strength offers
                increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and greater sensitivity to contrast mechanisms
                that rely on differences in magnetic susceptibility (e.g., the blood oxygenation
                level-dependent (BOLD) effect) (1-3). However, there are several factors which
                make MRI of the human brain more challenging at high field strength. These include
                (i) inhomogeneity of the RF transmit and receive fields
                (B1) caused by field focusing effects (4,5) and
                (ii) field-dependent alterations of tissue relaxation rates (6). MR pulse sequence development and optimization therefore
                must be performed in order to achieve optimal image quality at a particular field
                strength. Despite these potential difficulties, high-resolution functional MRI
                    (7) and
                T2-weighted structural imaging (8,9) have been performed
                successfully at field strengths of greater than 3 T and demonstrate significant
                improvements over their low field equivalents.

For structural imaging of the whole brain, 3D
                T1-weighted rapid gradient echo approaches are generally
                used. At lower field strength (&lt;3 T), fast low angle shot (FLASH) or
                magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo methods provide good contrast among gray
                matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, these
                methods perform more poorly at higher field strengths due to the longer
                    T1 values. 3D modified driven equilibrium Fourier
                transform (3D MDEFT) imaging has been proposed as an alternative technique for
                achieving good T1 contrast over the whole brain,
                initially at 4 T (10) and more recently at 3
                and 1.5 T (11). 2D MDEFT has also been used
                at 8 T for structural T1-weighted imaging of a limited
                number of slices (12). In order to achieve
                the optimum T1 contrast, center-out phase encoding is
                used for the innermost loop of the 3D MDEFT sequence (13). However, this increases the sensitivity of the technique
                to RF inhomogeneities, which are more prominent at higher field. As a result, tissue
                signal and contrast will vary considerably over the imaging volume unless additional
                measures are taken to reduce the B1 sensitivity of the
                sequence. Low flip angle adiabatic pulses (e.g., BIR-4 (14)) are impractical as excitation pulses for fast gradient
                echo sequences at high field strength due to their duration and power requirements,
                and so alternative B1 compensation pulses have been
                proposed. These have spatially varying flip angles in either one (13) or two (15) dimensions, with the shape of the pulse profile designed to counteract
                the RF inhomogeneity. This technique works well at 2 T where the main source of
                    B1 variation is the RF coil, which is constant
                across subjects and can be accurately approximated by a simple function. However, at
                4.7 T the dominant source of B1 inhomogeneity is the RF
                focusing effect, which depends on factors such as subject positioning relative to
                the RF coil and subject head size. Therefore, in order to accurately account for
                this problem using B1 compensation pulses, it would be
                necessary to acquire B1 profiles on a subject-by-subject
                basis and generate compensation pulses using this information. This would increase
                the total scan time required, which is undesirable if multiple imaging protocols are
                required within a single session (e.g., if MDEFT is used as a structural reference
                scan for a BOLD functional MRI study). Also, multidimensional RF compensation pulses
                reduce the efficiency of the MDEFT acquisition, because they are inevitably longer
                than standard nonselective hard pulses and consequently cause an increase in TE and
                TR. Therefore, a method which automatically corrects for RF inhomogeneities in all
                directions without prior knowledge of the exact spatial variation of the
                    B1 field in the head, and without increasing TE and
                TR, is desirable.

In this work, we propose a modification to the 3D MDEFT technique that
                reduces its sensitivity to RF inhomogeneity while retaining high
                    T1 contrast in brain tissue. This modification
                consists of replacing the inversion pulse of the MDEFT preparation period (which is
                often an adiabatic hyperbolic secant (sech) pulse (16), chosen for its insensitivity to RF inhomogeneity (12)) with a standard nonselective hard pulse
                with a nominal flip angle of 130°. Although perhaps counterintuitive, the
                use of a B1-sensitive preparation pulse reduces the
                    B1 sensitivity of the overall sequence, due to the
                counteracting effects of the preparation pulse and the excitation pulses. In the
                adiabatic sequence, image nonuniformity occurs as a result of a spatial variation of
                the excitation flip angle. Regions with higher B1 have
                greater signal due to a higher flip angle. However, if the inversion pulse
                efficiency is also made to vary with B1, regions with
                higher B1 will be inverted more efficiently, and
                therefore the amplitude of the longitudinal magnetization at the end of the
                inversion time delay will be reduced. The two effects of excitation flip angle and
                inversion efficiency work in opposite directions and will tend to cancel each other
                out. Therefore, the use of a hard preparation pulse in MDEFT is predicted to reduce
                image signal nonuniformity. Using this sequence,
                T1-weighted 3D image volumes of the whole human brain
                have been acquired at 4.7 T with a resolution of 1 × 1 × 1
                    mm3.

THEORY
The standard 3D MDEFT sequence consists of three main components: (i) a
                global saturation pulse to null both the longitudinal and the transverse
                magnetization; (ii) after a recovery time delay (TD), a 180° pulse is
                applied to invert the longitudinal magnetization; (iii) after an inversion recovery
                delay (TI), a 3D imaging technique (e.g., spoiled 3D FLASH) is used to acquire image
                data. The sequence is repeated a number of times in order to build up the whole
                imaging data matrix, with each repeat acquiring data for different regions of the 3D
                    kspace volume. The contrast in an MDEFT image is determined by
                the state of the longitudinal magnetization at the end of the TI delay, immediately
                prior to image acquisition. In order to calculate this, we consider the evolution of
                the tissue magnetization from the time of saturation to the end of the TI delay.

Assuming perfect saturation, the tissue longitudinal magnetization (Mz)
                following MDEFT preparation is given by  [1] MZ(TI)=M0(1−(1−cosϕ[1−exp(−TD∕T1)]exp(−TI∕T1)), 

where M0 is the value of the longitudinal
                magnetization at equilibrium, T1 is the longitudinal
                relaxation time of the tissue, TD is the time between saturation and inversion
                pulses, TI is the inversion time, and ϕ is the inversion pulse flip
                angle. If TD ' TI and ϕ = 180°, Eq. [1] becomes  [2] MZ(TI)=M0[1−exp(−TI∕T1)]2, 

which is the standard expression quoted for the signal intensity in an MDEFT
                image (10,12). However, there is no fundamental reason for TD and TI to have the same
                value, and it has been shown that an asymmetric MDEFT sequence in which TD &lt;
                TI provides better GM—WM contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) at 1.5 and 3 T
                    (11) than the symmetric equivalent.
                Therefore, for MDEFT parameter optimization at 4.7 T, TD and TI were allowed to have
                different values.

Numerical simulations were performed to investigate the dependence of the
                MDEFT signal intensity on RF inhomogeneity and the effect of this on GM/WM SNR and
                CNR. In order to do this, the following tissue parameters were assumed:
                    T1(WM) = 1.05 s and
                T1(GM) = 1.5 s (based on measurements made in other
                laboratories at 4 and 4.7 T (6,17)). A parameter optimization scheme described
                previously was used (11), resulting in
                sequence timings of TD = 0.25 s and TI = 0.35 s. From Eq. [1], the magnetization excited by the first RF pulse of the
                imaging sequence is  [3] MMDEFT=M0(1−(1−cosϕ[1−exp(−TD∕T1)]exp(−TI∕T1)⋅sinθ, 

where θ is the flip angle of the excitation pulse. For these
                simulations, the contrast in the MDEFT images was assumed to be determined by the
                values given by Eq. [3], since
                center-out phase encoding was used for the innermost loop of the imaging sequence
                (see Methods). The sensitivity of the technique to RF inhomogeneity was assessed by
                varying θ and examining the effect on MMDEFT.
                Three variations of the MDEFT sequence were simulated: MDEFT with an adiabatic hyperbolic secant inversion pulse (which
                            has very good inversion efficiency and is insensitive to RF
                            inhomogeneities), for which ϕ was assumed to have a constant
                            value of 180°.

MDEFT with a hard inversion pulse, for which ϕ was
                            assumed to vary with θ, with its maximum value
                            (180°) when θ had its nominal value. It was
                            assumed that the flip angles of the excitation and inversion pulses were
                            proportional, so that if the inversion pulse flip angle was
                            180° when θ = 23°, it would be
                            90° when θ = 11.5°.

MDEFT with a reduced flip angle hard pulse preparation, for
                            which the nominal flip angle of the “inversion”
                            pulse was reduced to 130°. This corresponds to the value of
                            the inversion pulse flip angle when θ has its nominal value.
                            As above, the flip angle of this preparation pulse was assumed to vary
                            linearly with θ. Other values of nominal inversion pulse flip
                            angle were also investigated, and 130° was found to result in
                            the greatest degree of insensitivity to B1
                            field variations (data not shown).



In all three cases, the initial MDEFT saturation pulse was assumed to
                completely null all longitudinal magnetization at the beginning of the preparation
                period. This assumption was justified by the use of adiabatic half passage RF pulses
                for this purpose.

METHODS
All imaging was performed using a 4.7-T, 90 cm borediameter magnet (Magnex
                Scientific Ltd, Oxford, UK) controlled by a console supported by Philips Medical
                Systems (Eindhoven, Holland) based on a MR5000 design (SMIS Ltd., Guilford, UK). A
                shielded head gradient coil was used (Magnex Scientific Ltd.), providing gradient
                fields of up to 36 mT/m with a maximum slew rate of 195 mT/m/ms. Images were
                acquired using a transmit/receive fourport drive birdcage RF coil with an internal
                diameter of 28 cm. Six normal healthy volunteers were scanned after informed consent
                and approval from the University College London Hospital Ethics Committee.

RF pulse calibration was carried out manually on a 5-mm axial slice
                coincident with the maximum of the B1 profile in the
                axial direction using the method of van der Meulen and van Yperen (18). We have previously found that using this
                method in the human head at 4.7 T, the mean RF flip angle obtained is approximately
                15% higher than the desired flip angle (due to the topography of the
                    B1 maps, with the B1
                maximum being focused in a central spot and regions of lower
                    B1 forming concentric rings around this spot; for
                examples of B1 maps of the human head at 4.7 T, see
                    (19)). Therefore, the value obtained from
                the calibration was divided by 1.15, and this value was used for the hard RF pulse
                power. Adiabatic pulse power settings were chosen to ensure that the adiabatic
                condition was satisfied (16).

3D MDEFT was implemented as described previously (10,11). The image
                orientation was chosen such that the read gradient was applied along the
                superior—inferior direction. The image matrix size was 256 (read)
                × 224 (PEinner) × 176 (PEouter). In the
                read direction, 2 × oversampling was used to avoid signal aliasing from
                the lower regions of the head/neck (i.e., 512 complex data points were sampled per
                acquisition). Center-out phase encoding was used in the PEinner loop and
                the data were acquired in two segments. The first segment covered one half of
                    kPEinner-space from the center out (112 lines) and
                the second segment covered the other half of
                kPEinner-space from the center out (also 112 lines).
                Each segment was preceded by its own MDEFT preparation period. This two segment
                acquisition was repeated 176 times for each step in the PEouter
                direction. Using a parameter optimization scheme (11) designed to maximize GM/WM/CSF CNR for a given total scan time at 4.7 T
                (assuming T1(GM) = 1.5 s,
                T1(WM) = 1.05 s, and T1(CSF)
                = 4.6 s; spin densities ρ(GM) = 0.75, ρ(WM) = 0.65, and
                ρ(CSF) = 1 [arbitrary units]; T2* = 25 ms),
                the following sequence parameters were chosen: TD = 250 ms; TI = 350 ms; acquisition
                bandwidth (BWacq) = 50 kHz; nominal excitation flip angle =
                23°; TR = 13.1 ms; TE = 5.2 ms; gradient spoiling in read and
                    PEinner directions and RF spoiling; phase encode gradient rewinding
                along both PE directions; FOV = 256 × 176 × 224 mm3
                to give 1 × 1 × 1 mm3 spatial resolution. The total
                scan time was 12 min 8 s. In order to minimize the echo time, an asymmetric echo
                acquisition was used in the read direction so that the peak signal occurred at point
                192 rather than point 256 (the center of the 512 point acquisition). For the MDEFT
                saturation pulse, two successive adiabatic half passage sech pulses were used. For
                the MDEFT inversion, three types of pulse were used: (i) adiabatic sech pulse
                (μ = 5, β = 1250 s-1 ∴ BW = 1989 Hz);
                (ii) hard nominal 180° pulse (duration 680 μs ∴ BW
                = 1471Hz); and (iii) hard nominal 130° pulse (same duration as
                180° pulse). Standard hard pulses were used for RF excitation in the
                imaging section of the sequence. Images were generated using a 3D-FT with a Hanning
                filter applied to the first and last 12.5% of the data in all three dimensions. No
                other image processing or intensity correction schemes were used to enable
                straightforward comparison of images and assessment of signal intensity variation.

In order to assess the practical utility of the three MDEFT sequences, the
                image data sets were partitioned into WM, GM, and CSF maps using a segmentation
                algorithm based on a modified “mixture model” cluster analysis
                method (20). Following segmentation, an
                assessment of “image uniformity” was performed. In order to
                achieve this, it was necessary to remove the contrast due to tissue type (GM, WM,
                and CSF). Using the WM and GM maps created from the hard 130° MDEFT
                images, voxels with a probability greater than 0.8 of being eitherWMor GM were
                identified. The corresponding voxels were selected from each of the three original
                data sets to generate images containing signal from GM and WM only. The image
                intensity of the voxels that were identified as being GM were multiplied by a factor
                greater than 1 to remove differences in pixel intensity due to tissue type (the
                value of this factor was based on the average ratio of SI for GM and WM over the
                whole brain). The images were smoothed by convolution with a boxcar kernel of 8-mm
                width. To remove the confounding effect of zero intensity pixels, which occur at
                tissue boundaries in the combined GM/WM images (where partial volume effects cause
                the probabilities of GM/WM to be less than 0.8), the smoothed images were normalized
                using a mask created from the combined GM/WM images and convolved with the same
                smoothing kernel. The resulting image uniformity maps have an intensity that
                directly reflects the degree of SI nonuniformity present in the image data.

RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the results of the
                simulation studies. The horizontal axes of the graphs in Fig. 1 correspond to the amplitude of the
                    B1 field and are represented in terms of the flip
                angle of the RF excitation pulse, which is proportional to
                B1. In the case of the sech inversion pulse (Fig. 1a), only the flip angle of the excitation
                pulse varies with RF power, because the inversion pulse is insensitive to variations
                in B1. Consequently, there is a strong dependence of
                signal intensity (SI) on B1 field amplitude. If a
                nominal 180° hard pulse is used for inversion, the actual inversion
                efficiency varies with B1. In Fig. 1b, the nominal flip angle of the excitation pulse is
                23° and the nominal flip angle of the inversion pulse is 180°.
                Variations in B1 cause the excitation pulse flip angle
                to be higher or lower than 23° and the inversion pulse flip angle to be
                correspondingly higher or lower than 180°. However, it is important to
                note that in both cases the inversion efficiency decreases. This results in the
                behavior shown in Fig. 1b. When
                    B1 is less than or equal to its nominal value, the
                SI in WM and GM is relatively uniform, leading to a nearconstant WM—GM
                signal difference. This is because the loss of signal due to a lower flip angle is
                compensated for by the reduction in inversion efficiency. However, as the
                    B1 field amplitude increases to higher than its
                nominal value, the SI begins to increase rapidly for both WM and GM. This is because
                the high flip angle and reduced inversion efficiency both cause an increase in the
                amount of excited magnetization. This will cause regions in the center of the brain,
                where the B1 field has its maximum value due to field
                focusing effects (21), to have high SI. The
                problem of SI increase at high B1 can be eliminated by
                reducing the nominal flip angle of the inversion pulse from 180 to 130°,
                as shown in Fig. 1c. In this case, the increase
                of flip angle with B1 continues to be opposed by an
                increase in inversion efficiency, even at levels higher than the nominal values.
                Therefore, the SI of WM and GM is reasonably constant over the wide range of
                    B1 values represented in Fig. 1 and, importantly, there is no overlap in the range of SI
                covered by each of the tissue types, i.e., the minimum of the WMSI curve is greater
                than the maximum of the GM SI curve. A relatively constant CNR is achieved, as
                indicated by the flatness of the WM—GM difference curve shown in Fig. 1c.

Figure 2 summarizes the predicted range
                of WM and GM signal intensities resulting from a range of
                B1 fields that correspond to flip angles from 13 to
                34° for the three sequences (as in Fig.
                1). This figure contains the same information as presented in Fig. 1, but makes it easier to appreciate two
                crucial points about the MDEFT sequence with the 130° hard pulse: first,
                the much reduced extent of the variation of signal intensity for both WM and GM, and
                second, the lack of overlap between the WM and GM ranges. Also, it is important to
                note that the difference between the mean WM signal and the mean GM signal (shown by
                the horizontal bars in the graph in Fig. 2) for
                the hard 130° MDEFT sequence is similar to that of the two other
                sequences (0.020, 0.022, and 0.022 in the units of Fig. 2 for the sech, hard 180°, and hard 130°
                sequences, respectively). This means that, on average, there is no loss of
                WM—GM CNR when using the hard 130° preparation pulse. All
                these factors should combine to help to facilitate automatic tissue-based image
                segmentation.

Examples of human brain images acquired at 4.7 T using the three variants of
                the 3D MDEFT sequence are shown in Fig. 3. Note
                that no image processing or intensity correction schemes have been applied in the
                generation of these images. Several of the predictions made by the simulations are
                apparent in these images. First, the B1-dependent signal
                dropout in the standard MDEFT sequence is visible in the outermost areas of the
                brain, particularly in the inferior regions of the cerebellum and the superior
                region of the cerebrum (Fig. 3a). This
                corresponds to the predictions from Fig. 1a:
                the SI increases with B1, i.e., from peripheral to
                central brain areas, leading to low SI at the edges. By using a hard 180°
                inversion pulse (Fig. 3b), the SI in these
                regions of dropout increases, but a SI “hotspot” appears in
                the region of highest B1 at the center of the brain.
                This corresponds to the predictions from Fig.
                1b: SI is constant when B1 is low (i.e., no
                considerable losses in peripheral areas), but there is a strong increase in SI when
                    B1 is high, leading to the intensity hotspot in the
                center of the brain. This actually worsens the overall SI uniformity compared to the
                MDEFT sequence with the adiabatic inversion. Signal uniformity is considerably
                improved by using a hard 130° inversion pulse, as predicted in Fig. 1c and shown in Fig. 3c. The result is high-quality
                T1-weighted images with uniform intensity and good
                contrast among WM, GM, and CSF.

Figure 4 shows the image uniformity
                maps for three MDEFT sequences, with a structural image of the same transverse slice
                for anatomic reference. It is clear that SI uniformity of the images acquired using
                the 130° hard pulse MDEFT sequence (Fig.
                4d) is superior to that of the other sequences. Profiles along a line through
                the image uniformity maps illustrate the difference in the flatness of the maps.
                Analysis of a 6-cm transverse midbrain slab showed that the SD of the image
                uniformity map was 23.0, 34.8%,and 13.8% for the sech, hard 180°, and
                hard 130° sequences, respectively. Also, it is interesting to note that
                the mean value of the hard 130° MDEFT uniformity map is higher than that
                of the other two sequences (as predicted in Fig.
                1), resulting in overall higher image SNR.

DISCUSSION
3D MDEFT is an efficient method for providing structural
                    T1-weighted images of the human brain at high field
                strength. In this paper, a modification to the standard MDEFT approach is proposed,
                in which the adiabatic inversion preparation pulse is replaced by a hard pulse with
                a nominal flip angle of 130°. This modification, which is straightforward
                to implement and requires no extra pulse calibration, is designed to reduce the
                sensitivity of 3D MDEFT to RF inhomogeneity. It has been shown that using the
                standard MDEFT sequence at 4.7 T, the inherent B1
                inhomogeneity caused by RF focusing effects is sufficiently large to cause
                significant nonuniformities in signal intensity across the brain. Using the modified
                approach, these signal intensity variations are substantially reduced and
                high-quality T1-weighted images with uniform intensity
                and good contrast between different tissue types are obtained.

Another common method that is used to reduce the appearance of image
                nonuniformities is intensity correction during image postprocessing. Although this
                can result in images with apparently uniform intensity, it is important to note that
                if images are corrected in this way, differences in tissue contrast due to flip
                    angle/B1 inhomogeneity will still occur across the
                image. By addressing the issue of B1 inhomogeneity at
                the pulse sequence stage, the method proposed here achieves both uniform contrast
                and SI across the imaging volume. Residual variation in SI that remains due to the
                receive profile of the RF coil can be corrected for using image postprocessing. The
                proposed method is equally valid if different coils are used for transmission and
                reception, e.g., if a birdcage transmit coil is used with an array coil receiver. In
                this case, image postprocessing is a standard part of the image reconstruction,
                which takes account of the large differences in the spatial sensitivities of the
                array coil elements. Finally, while the effectiveness of the new method has been
                shown here for neuroimaging at 4.7 T, the principle is also applicable at any field
                strength where T1-weighted imaging using magnetization
                preparation suffers from problems caused by RF focusing and
                B1 inhomogeneity (e.g., 3 T).

In summary, a modification of the 3D MDEFT technique has been described that
                reduces the variation in image signal intensity caused by inhomogeneities in the RF
                field and allows the acquisition of high-quality whole-brain
                    T1-weighted images with good GM—WM CNR at
                4.7 T.

Figures
FIG. 1 Variation of MDEFT signal intensity with B1 field
                        using (a) a sech inversion pulse, (b) a hard
                        180° inversion pulse, and (c) a hard 130°
                        inversion pulse. Values shown are for white matter (WM, ◆) gray
                        matter (GM, ○), and the difference (WM—GM,*). The
                        horizontal dashed lines in (b) and (c) represent the lowest and highest
                        values of the WM—GM difference in (a). Signal intensity is
                        plotted against the actual excitation pulse flip angle, with the nominal
                        value being 23° for all three sequences (indicated by the
                        vertical dotted line)

FIG. 2 Range of signal intensity (SI) variation for B1
                        fields corresponding to the range of flip angles 13-34° for the
                        three variants of the MDEFT sequence. The symbols represent the extremes of
                        the SI ranges and the horizontal lines represent the mean SI value. Use of a
                        hard 130° preparation pulse greatly reduces the range of SI for
                        both white and gray matter while maintaining good contrast.

FIG. 3 Selection of sagittal images from a 3D MDEFT data set acquired using
                        (a) sech inversion, (b) hard 180°, and
                            (c) hard 130° preparation pulses. Use of the
                        130° preparation pulse eliminates the signal dropout seen at the
                        edge of the brain with the sech preparation and the SI hotspot in the center
                        of the brain seen with the hard 180° preparation.
