This file is available to download for the purposes of text mining, consistent with the principles of UK copyright law.Angiogenin is an unusual member of the pancreatic ribonuclease
superfamily that induces blood vessel formation and is a promising anticancer
target. The three-dimensional structure of murine angiogenin (mAng) has been
determined by X-ray crystallography. Two structures are presented, one a complex
with sulphate ions (1.5 Å-resolution) and the other with phosphate
ions (1.6 Å-resolution). Residues forming the putative B1,
P1 and B2 subsites occupy positions similar to their
hAng counterparts and are likely to play similar roles. The anions occupy the
P1 subsite, sulphate binding conventionally and phosphate
adopting two orientations, one of which is novel. The B1 subsite is
obstructed by Glu116 and Phe119, with the latter assuming a less invasive
position than its hAng counterpart. Hydrophobic interactions between the
C-terminal segment and the main body of the protein are more extensive than in
hAng and may underly the lower enzymatic activity of the murine protein.
Elsewhere, the structure of the H3–B2 loop supports the view that
hAng Asn61 interacts directly with cell surface molecules and does not merely
stabilize adjacent regions of the hAng structure. mAng crystals appear to offer
small-molecule inhibitors a clear route to the active site and may even
withstand a reorientation of the C-terminal segment that provides access to the
cryptic B1 subsite. These features represent considerable advantages
over crystalline hAng and bAng.

   1. Introduction
Angiogenin (Ang) is an angiogenic protein originally isolated from the
conditioned medium of HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Fett et al., 1985). It plays a role in tumour angiogenesis
(Olson et al., 1995; Olson et al., 2001; Kao et al., 2002; Olson et al.,
2002) and its increased expression has been correlated with diverse
cancers in more than 20 clinical studies to date (see Kao et al., 2002). Antagonists of Ang inhibit the
establishment, progression and metastasis of human tumour xenografts in athymic mice
(Olson et al., 1995; Olson et al., 2001; Kao et al., 2002; Olson et al.,
2002), identifying it as a promising target for anticancer therapy.

Human Ang (hAng) has been the subject of intensive functional and structural
analyses. It is a member of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily (Kurachi et al., 1985; Strydom et al., 1985) and possesses a weak ribonucleolytic
activity that is essential for angiogenicity (Shapiro et al., 1989; Shapiro and Vallee
1989; Curran et al., 1993a). Its
three-dimensional structure (Acharya et al.,
1994; Lequin et al., 1997; Leonidas et al., 1999a) is broadly similar to
that of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A; EC 3.1.27.5), with which it
shares 33 % sequence identity. Engineered hAng variants have enabled the
identification of structural elements that govern its characteristic cell binding
(Harper and Vallee 1989; Hallahan et al., 1991; Hallahan et al., 1992; Shapiro
and Vallee 1992; Holloway et al.,
2002), nuclear translocation (Moroianu and
Riordan 1994) and enzymatic (Harper and
Vallee 1988; 1989; Shapiro et al., 1989; Shapiro and Vallee 1989; Curran
et al., 1993a; Curran et al.,
1993b; Russo et al., 1994; Russo et al., 1996; Shapiro 1998; Leonidas et al.,
1999a; Holloway et al., 2002;
Leonidas et al., 2002; Holloway et al., 2004) activities. Once it
reaches the nucleus, Ang stimulates rRNA transcription, playing a key role in
endothelial cell proliferation that is necessary for angiogenesis induced by other
angiogenic factors (Kishimoto et al., 2005;
Tsuji et al., 2005).

Despite yielding much information, study of the human protein has
limitations. First, there are obvious practical difficulties in studying the role of
hAng in healthy living subjects. Second, in all known crystal forms of hAng
variants, key residues in the ribonucleolytic active site are intimately involved in
crystal packing (Leonidas et al., 2001). This
has prevented visualization of the binding of known low-molecular weight substrates
and inhibitors, in turn hampering the rational design of potential anticancer
agents. It has also obscured the precise nature of the change in protein
conformation that is believed to accompany the binding of pyrimidine nucleotides
(Russo et al., 1994). The crystal
structure of bovine Ang (bAng) (Acharya et al.,
1995) has proved to have similar limitations.

The murine Ang (mAng) system may offer solutions to the experimental problems
outlined above. The mAng gene shares 76% sequence identity with
hAng (Bond and Vallee 1990) and is known to
have comparable angiogenic activity and approximately one-third of its enzymatic
activity (Nobile et al., 1996). In addition,
the murine genome encodes five additional Ang-like proteins that appear to have
undergone positive selection (Brown et al.,
1995; Fu and Kamps 1997; Strydom 1998; Cho et al., 2005). At least one of these is angiogenic (Fu et al., 1999) but others may have different
functions (Nobile et al., 1996; Cho et al., 2005). Established protein
engineering and murine gene disruption techniques provide the means for probing the
physiological roles of these proteins while the continued use of structural biology
techniques will be essential for the validation and interpretation of such
experiments. As a first step along this route, we present here two X-ray crystal
structures of mAng. We assess their similarity to the structure of hAng, focusing on
regions involved in RNA cleavage and cell binding. We also examine the suitability
of these crystals for the visualization of small-molecule inhibitor binding.

2. Materials and methods
2.1 Protein preparation
mAng was prepared from the soluble extract of recombinant
Escherichia coli W3110 by cation-exchange chromatography on
SP-Sepharose and Mono-S media as described previously (Shapiro and Vallee 1992; Nobile et al., 1996). The sample was mixed with 0.25 vol 1 M
potassium phosphate, pH 9.0 and incubated overnight at 37 °C to
catalyse deamidation of the N-terminal residue from Gln to pyroGlu (Blombäck 1967), then purified
further by C4 reversed-phase HPLC (Holloway et al., 2001). The purified material was finally
lyophilized to dryness and reconstitued in AnalaR-grade water. Purity was
&gt;95% as judged by SDS-PAGE, reversed-phase HPLC and electrospray
ionisation-mass spectrometry (data not shown). Protein concentration was
determined from UV-absorbance at 280 nm using an estimated
ε280 (Pace et al.,
1995) of 6335 M−1 cm−1.

2.2. Crystallization and data collection
Crystals were grown by the hanging drop-vapour diffusion technique. Drops
were prepared by mixing 2 μl protein solution (15 mg
ml−1) with 2 μl reservoir solution and were
incubated at 16 °C suspended over 0.8 ml reservoirs. Two types of
crystal were grown, mAng·SO4 and
mAng·PO4. In the former case, the reservoir solution was
25% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4
(unbuffered), and in the latter, it was 25% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 M sodium
phosphate buffer, pH 5.2. mAng·SO4 crystals were thin
plates and reached their full size within three days.
mAng·PO4 crystals were thicker and grew more slowly,
continuing their growth for 1–2 months.

Diffraction data were collected at room temperature on station PX9.6 of
the Synchrotron Radiation Source (Daresbury, U.K.), which provided monochromatic
radiation of 0.87-Å wavelength and was equipped with an ADSC
Quantum-4 CCD detector. Data from two mAng·SO4 crystals
were merged and supplemented with further data from an in-house MAR Research 30
cm image plate mounted on a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode X-ray source emitting
CuKα radiation. Data from a single mAng·PO4
crystal were collected at the synchrotron. All data were indexed, scaled and
reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski
and Minor 1997), and intensities were truncated to amplitudes using
TRUNCATE (French and Wilson 1978).
Detailed data processing statistics are given in Table 1.

2.3. Structure determination and refinement
Initial phases were determined by the molecular replacement method as
implemented in AMoRe (Navaza 1994),
employing a search model derived from the crystal structure of bovine Ang (PDB
entry 1AGI) (Acharya et al., 1995). In
this search model, residues 1 and 121–125 were deleted and all
non-glycine residues that differed from their counterparts in mAng were replaced
by alanine. For both mAng·SO4 and
mAng·PO4, clear solutions were obtained, and the resultant
models were subjected to cycles of refinement in which simulated annealing,
coordinate minimization and B-factor refinement with CNS (Brünger et al., 1998) were
alternated with manual model building using O (Jones et al., 1991). During the final stages, restrained refinement
and electron density map calculations were performed with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997). Those residues
with partial density were truncated accordingly and residues for which there was
no discernible density were omitted. Polyvalent anions were then incorporated,
followed by the first two shells of water molecules. All water molecules had
peaks of ≥3σ in mFo
– DFc electron density maps. Detailed
statistics for each model are given in Table
1.

Model validation was conducted with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and the WHAT_CHECK server (Rodriguez et al., 1998). Structural
superpositions were performed with LSQMAN (Kleywegt and Jones 1994) and topological classification with
PROMOTIF3 (Hutchinson and Thornton 1996).
Omit phases were calculated with SFCHECK (Vaguine et al., 1999). Figures were drawn using PyMOL (DeLano
Scientific, San Carlos, CA).

3. Results
3.1 Structural overview
mAng is a monomeric protein of 121 residues. It adopts the
α/β fold that is characteristic of other angiogenins and
members of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily (Figure 1A). When compared to hAng, it has two single residue
deletions, one at residues 59/60 and one at the C-terminus (Figure 1B). The former affects the numbering of residues
60–121, which have values of one less than their hAng counterparts.

The data enabled the modelling of the polypeptide backbone of residues
3–119 in the mAng·SO4 structure and residues
2–119 in the mAng·PO4 structure. The topologies
of the two structures are extremely similar, the Cα atoms
of residues 3–119 overlaying with an rms deviation of just 0.14
Å. They also superpose closely with the structures of hAng (PDB entry
1B1I) (Leonidas et al., 1999a) and bAng
(PDB entry 1AGI) (Acharya et al., 1995):
the Cα atoms of mAng·SO4 (residues
4–58 and 60–118) deviate from those of hAng (residues
4–58 and 61–119) and bAng (residues 5–59 and
62–120) by 0.62 and 0.66 Å (rms), respectively; the
corresponding figures for mAng·PO4 are 0.60 and 0.64
Å. Excepting the N- and C-termini, the largest deviations between
equivalent Cα atoms of mAng and hAng occur in close
proximity to glycine residues (no.s 20, 48, 58 and 85) and are no larger than
1.9 Å. Of these residues, glycines 20, 48 and 85 are conserved and
probably impart some flexibility to each structure. Gly58, however, is novel to
mAng and precedes the single residue deletion identified above. Structure-based
alignment of mAng, hAng and bAng reveals a close correspondence of secondary
structure elements (Figure 1B).

The electron density maps for the mAng·SO4 and
mAng·PO4 structures are of high quality (Figures 2A and 2B) and show that, in each case, the side chains of Gln12, Ser34, Ser51,
Ser62, Met70, Ser96, His113 and Ser117 have two or more distinct conformations.
Unique to the mAng·SO4 model are dual conformations of
Val42 and Ser51, and unique to the mAng·PO4 model are dual
conformations of Lys50, Lys72 and Ser73. The extremities of Asp3, Arg5, Lys8,
Lys17, Lys19, Arg24, Arg28, Lys31, Arg32, Ser37, Asp41, Asn67, Lys81, Ser86,
Arg88, Gln92, Arg94, Glu107 and Ser120 show more significant disorder and cannot
be modelled.

3.2. Structure of the P1 subsite
Residues of the P1 subsite bind and catalyse the cleavage of
the scissile phosphodiester linkage of RNA substrates. At this subsite in RNase
A, the side chains of His12, Lys41 and His119 are directly involved in
catalysis, while the side chain of Gln11 and the main chain of Phe120 make
significant hydrogen bonds with the phosphodiester moiety (Raines 1998 and references therein). In mAng, the catalytic
triad is conserved in the form of His13, Lys40 and His113. The positions and
conformations of these residues are highly similar in each of the two mAng
structures, and are in accordance with their likely catalytic function. The side
chain of His113 is observed in two conformations that correspond to those
designated A (χ1 ≈ 160°,
χ2 ≈ 80°) and B
(χ1 ≈ −75°,
χ2 ≈ −55°) in RNase A
(Borkakoti et al., 1982). In the
mAng·PO4 structure, conformation A has greater
occupancy (≈ 80 %), while in the mAng·SO4
structure, the two conformations are evenly occupied. Each structure also
reveals that an anion from the crystallization medium is ligated to the
catalytic triad, the side chain of Gln12 (the counterpart of RNase A Gln11) and
the main chain nitrogen atom of Phe114 (the counterpart of RNase A Phe120)
(Figure 2, Table 2). Two conformations of the Gln12 side chain are
present in each structure, designated A and B. The most significant difference
between conformations A and B is a ≈100° rotation of the
terminal amide group.

There are minor differences between mAng and hAng in the conformations
of some of the P1 subsite residues. In crystal structures of hAng,
His114 (the counterpart of mAng His113) has been observed in conformation A
only, although a dynamic equilibrium between the A and B conformers has been
deduced from NMR spectroscopy of hAng solutions (Lequin et al., 1997). The conformations of Lys40 in the mAng and
hAng (free or phosphate-bound) structures differ such that their
Nζ atoms are displaced by ≈ 1.5
Å, while the orientations of the Gln12 side chain amide group also
differ. These differences are difficult to explain in the absence of the
structure of unliganded mAng, but they may reflect fine differences in anion
binding, described below.

Although there are obvious similarities between phosphate and sulphate
ions, there are differences in the way that each binds to the P1
subsite of mAng. Phosphate binds in two equally-populated but markedly different
orientations that have a common position for one oxygen atom, which we designate
O1. In orientation A, the anion is particularly well coordinated, making
hydrogen bonds to five P1 subsite residues: Gln12 (conformation A),
His13, Lys40, His113 (both conformations) and Phe115 (Figure 2C, Table 2).
This represents all possible interactions contained within the crystalline
complexes of RNase A with phosphate (PDB entry 5RSA) (Wlodawer and Sjölin 1983), sulphate (eg. PDB
entries 3RN3 and 1DY5) (Howlin et al.,
1989; Esposito et al., 2000) or
dinucleotide inhibitors (eg. PDB entry 1RPG) (Zegers et al., 1994). Orientation A is also similar to the single
orientation observed in the hAng·PO4 structure (PDB entry
1HBY) (Leonidas et al., 2001) (Figure 2F) but with somewhat better
hydrogen-bonding geometry (Table 2).
Orientation B is substantially different, and, to our knowledge, is novel (Figure 2E). It is incompatible with
conformation B of His113 but permits hydrogen bonds with all the above
P1 residues except Lys40. Sulphate binds to the P1 subsite
in a single orientation that is offset slightly from phosphate orientation A
(Figure 2D). Although some specifics of
the hydrogen bonds are different (His13 bonds to O3 instead of O1, His113 bonds
in conformation A only, and Gln12 bonds in conformation A rather than
conformation B; Table 2), the same five
residues ligate the anion.

3.3. Structure of the B1 subsite and C-terminal segment
The B1 subsite binds the nucleotide base positioned upstream
of the scissile phosphodiester bond and has been well characterised in RNase A
(and derivatives thereof) where it takes the form of a narrow pocket comprising
residues His12, Val43, Asn44, Thr45, Phe120 and Ser123. The primary component of
the site is Thr45 which forms hydrogen bonds with the polar groups at positions
2 and 3 of pyrimidine bases (Richards et al.,
1970; Wlodawer et al., 1983;
delCardayré and Raines 1995). Mutational analyses indicate that hAng
Thr44 is the functional counterpart of RNase Thr45 (Curran et al., 1993a; Holloway et al., 2004). Crystal structures of wild-type proteins
show that hAng residues His13, Ile42, Asn43 and Leu115 are the spatial
counterparts of RNase A residues His12, Val43, Asn44 and Phe120 (Acharya et al., 1994; Leonidas et al., 1999a). However, the anticipated binding
position of the pyrimidine is obstructed by Gln117 and Phe120, and the only
reasonable way in which hAng can bind RNA substrates requires a major structural
rearrangement of the C-terminal region (residues 117–123) (Leonidas et al., 2002).

The residues comprising the likely B1 subsites of mAng and
hAng are partially conserved. There are two amino acid substitutions: in mAng,
Val42 replaces Ile42 and Phe114 replaces Leu115. Nevertheless, the B1
subsite residues of mAng occupy positions similar to their hAng counterparts and
are likely to play similar roles (Figure
3). The site is obstructed by Glu116 whose side chain makes two hydrogen
bonds with Thr44 that are analogous to those made between Gln117 and Thr44 in
hAng (Table 3). The side chain of Thr44
is also hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Thr79, replicating the
Thr44–Thr80 interaction found in hAng. The other potential obstructor
of the B1 subsite, Phe119, assumes a less invasive position than its
hAng counterpart (Phe120) (Figure 3).
Superposition with the RNase A·uridine vanadate complex (PDB entry
1RUV) (Ladner et al., 1997) indicates
that the side chain of Phe119 (atom Cδ2) is 3.6
Å distant from the heteroatom at position 4 of the pyrimidine,
somewhat further away than its hAng counterpart is (atom
Cβ at 2.3 Å). The side chains of these
corresponding Phe residues also differ noticeably in conformation, their
χ2 torsion angles differing by
37–39°. These differences appear to be a consequence of
the Leu→Phe substitution at mAng position 114. Indeed, Phe114 and
Phe119 make direct contact, leading to a slight reorientation of Phe119 and
downstream residues of the C-terminal segment that raises the mAng
versus hAng Cα deviation from 0.3
Å at position 117 to 2.3 Å at position 119 (mAng
numbering). This is also a characteristic of the bAng structure, which features
an equivalent Leu→Phe substitution.

The closed conformation of hAng is stabilized by Gln117–Thr44
and Ser118–Asp116 hydrogen bonds and by the hydrophobic packing of
the Ile119 and Phe120 side chains against the main body of the protein (Harper and Vallee 1988; Curran et al., 1993b; Russo et al., 1994; Russo
et al., 1996; Shapiro 1998;
Leonidas et al., 2002). In mAng, the
hydrogen bonds are comparable (Table 3)
while, as a consequence of several amino acid substitutions (Phe114 for Leu115,
Phe118 for Ile119, Tyr64 for His65), the hydrophobic interactions are more
extensive. In more detail, the side chains of Phe118 and Phe119 (the
counterparts of Ile119 and Phe120 in hAng) are cradled in a pocket lined by
residues from six β-strands (Figure
4). These residues can be divided into those that form the pocket base
(Met70, Val77, Arg100, His101 and Val102) and those that form a collar (Thr44,
Tyr64, Thr79, Val103 and Phe114). Both Phe118 and Phe119 make extensive contacts
with residues from each layer (Figures 4A
and 4C). In contrast, Ile119 and Phe120 of
hAng interact closely with the base (and with each other) but much less so with
the collar (Figures 4B and 4D).

3.4. Structure of the B2 subsite and the H3–B2 loop
The B2 subsite binds the nucleotide base positioned
downstream of the scissile phosphodiester bond. In RNase A, adenine binding
involves nonpolar interactions with the side chains of His 119
(π-π stacking), Cys65 and Ala109, strong hydrogen bonds to
the side chain of Asn71 and transient hydrogen bonds to Asn67, Gln69 and Glu111
(Richards et al., 1970; Tarragona-Fiol et al., 1993; Fontecilla-Camps et al., 1994; Zegers et al., 1994; Toiron et al., 1996). Several of these residues are
contributed by a disulfide-stabilized loop (residues 65–72) located
between strands B2 and B3. In Ang family members, this loop and its disulfide
bridge are not conserved and the structure of the B2 subsite is not
easily discerned (Leonidas et al.,
1999a). The subsite may be rather rudimentary, perhaps limited to
counterparts of the nonpolar elements of the RNase A subsite, i.e. residues
His114, Leu69 and Ala106 in hAng. These three residues are conserved in mAng and
occupy positions similar to their hAng counterparts. Any interactions that they
make with substrates are likely to be conserved.

The roles of RNase A and Ang residues in the region of strand B2 have
diverged over the course of evolution. Whereas several of these residues are
employed by RNase A for substrate binding (as described above), a subset
(residues 60–68 in hAng) is implicated in the interaction of Ang with
the surface of endothelial cells (Leonidas et
al., 1999a). Among these is Asn61, which is located in the
solvent-exposed loop that connects strand B2 to the preceding helix, H3.
Proteolytic cleavage of the 60/61 peptide bond or deamidation of Asn61 to isoAsp
abolishes angiogenic activity but has no appreciable effect on enzymatic
activity (Hallahan et al., 1991; Hallahan et al., 1992). Variants with
either of these modifications lack the ability to inhibit Ang-induced
neovascularization, indicating the perturbation of a critical cell-binding site.
The importance of Asn61 may lie in its ability to interact directly with cell
surface molecules or in its role in stabilizing the structure of two adjacent
regions with which it forms three hydrogen bonds (Asn 61
Nδ2–O Ser 52, Asn 61
Nδ2–Oγ Ser 52 and Ser
74 N–Oδ1 Asn 61). The structure of mAng narrows
down these possibilities. Whereas in hAng, the H3–B2 connection is a
type I β-turn comprising four residues
(Glu58–Asn59–Lys60–Asn61), in mAng the
connection comprises only three (Gly58–Ala59–Asn60) and
features two nonconservative substitutions. The electron density map for this
region is well defined in the mAng·SO4 and
mAng·PO4 structures and shows that the type I
β-turn is present in modified form
(Gly58–Ala59–Asn60–Gly61). The extended
torsional freedom of the two glycine residues in the turn prevent perturbation
of helix H3 and strand B2. Asn60 (the counterpart of hAng Asn61) makes no direct
contact with the rest of the protein (Figure
5). Instead, the Asn60 side chain adopts a more solvent-exposed
orientation in which it is free to hydrogen bond with Lys72 from a
symmetry-related molecule (not shown). A network of water molecules separates
Asn60 from Ser52 and Asn73 (the counterparts of hAng Ser52 and Ser74),
suggesting that the side chain of Asn 60/61 is not essential for the positioning
of residues 52 and 73/74.

3.5. Crystal packing and the potential binding of inhibitors
Crystal packing orients the central substrate-binding subsites of mAng
(B1, P1 and B2) towards a well-defined
solvent channel. The accessibility of these subsites to a known dinucleotide
inhibitor such as
5′-phospho-2′-deoxyuridine-3′-pyrophosphate
(P′→5′) adenosine 3′-phosphate
(pdUppA-3′-p) (Russo et al.,
2001) can be gauged by aligning each of the mAng structures with that of
the RNase A·pdUppA-3′-p complex (PDB entry 1QHC) (Leonidas et al., 1999b) and superposing the
dinucleotide coordinates with those of mAng. This type of analysis suggests that
the pathway of such a ligand to the active site (the obstructive conformation of
the C-terminus aside) is clear (Figure 6A).
Furthermore, none of the likely dinucleotide-binding residues make
intermolecular crystal contacts.

In order for a given small-molecule inhibitor to bind to Ang, it may be
necessary for the C-terminus to disengage from the main body of the protein. For
this to occur in a crystal-soaking experiment, there will need to be sufficient
room for manoeuvre of the C-terminus within the crystal. In mAng crystals, the
C-terminal segment approaches two symmetry-related molecules (Figure 6B), which we designate SYM MOL 1
(lattice position −b +c, symmetry
operator −x+½,
y+½−, z) and SYM MOL 2
(lattice position −b, symmetry operator
−x+½,
y+½−, z). Due to
different degrees of ordering at their N-termini, the
mAng·SO4 and mAng·PO4 structures
differ in the extent of the interaction. In mAng·PO4
(which has the best-ordered N-terminus), the Cε1 atom of
Phe118 lies 3.7 Å from the Cβ atom of Asp2 from
SYM MOL 1. The two side chains make contact ‘end-on’ and
the C-terminal segment does not appear to be constrained by the interaction.
Furthermore, in mAng·SO4, the side chains of all residues
upstream of Ser4 are disordered and no contact is evident. The C-terminal
segment also approaches helix H2 and the preceding loop of SYM MOL 2 but does
not make direct contact (Figure 6B). Here,
the main chain conformation orientates the side chains of Lys19, Arg24 and Arg28
toward the C-terminal segment. However, in the mAng·PO4
structure, none of these side chains are ordered beyond
Cβ. In the mAng·SO4 structure, Arg24
shows electron density out to Cδ but the other two are
again disordered beyond Cβ. Thus, it appears that these
side chains have considerable mobility within either crystal form.

In summary, mAng crystals appear to offer small-molecule inhibitors
ample access to the active site and may even withstand a modest change in the
conformation of the C-terminal segment.

4. Discussion
As might be expected on consideration of sequence homology alone, the
structure of mAng is extremely similar to that of hAng. Nevertheless, minor
differences between the two orthologs have provided some insight into RNA cleavage
activity and cell binding. There are subtle differences between the enzymatic
properties of mAng and hAng (Nobile et al.,
1996; Shapiro 1998). First, the
specific activity of mAng is only about one-third of that of hAng as judged by the
ability to cleave tRNA or dinucleotide substrates. This seems most likely to be due
to enhanced hydrophobic interactions at the C-terminus of mAng which stabilize the
‘closed’ conformation, presenting a higher energetic barrier
to substrate turnover. This view is supported by studies on the contribution of
hydrophobic interactions to the C-terminal conformation of hAng. When these
interactions are weakened through the introduction of mutations at the C-terminus
(I119A/F120A) or by exposure to methanol, enzymatic activity is enhanced
3–4-fold but substrate specificity is unaffected (Russo et al., 1996; Leonidas et
al., 2002). Hence, an increase in the hydrophobic interactions as
observed in mAng would be likely to cause a severalfold suppression of enzymatic
activity. Next, whereas hAng has a 12-fold preference for C over U at the
B1 subsite, mAng has a somewhat stronger 35-fold preference. This
suggests modification of the recognition of the substituent(s) at positions 3 and/or
4 of the pyrimidine. There are no structural differences in the vicinity of Thr44
that might affect its ability to form hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen function at
position 3, and the nature of the interaction with the heteroatom at position 4 is
unknown. Nearby, two nonpolar residues are conservatively substituted (hAng Ile42
→ mAng Val42, hAng Leu115 → mAng Phe114) and there is a small
shift in the alignment of the C-terminal segment. However, it is not possible to
predict what bearing this might have on C/U selectivity and the resolution of this
issue awaits a direct observation of pyrimidine binding. In contrast, mAng and hAng
have very similar selectivities favoring A over G at the B2 subsite (4-
and 3-fold, respectively). This is consistent with the conservation of the identity
and positioning of the putative B2 subsite residues His114, Leu69 and
Ala106 (hAng numbering). Finally, the mAng structure supports the view that the side
chain of Asn61 in hAng binds directly to a molecule on the endothelial cell surface
and does not merely stabilize adjacent segments of the hAng structure.

The structures presented here indicate that, in several respects,
crystalline mAng is a promising tool for the study of Ang structure-function
relationships, particularly those relating to enzymatic activity. First, the
catalytic and specificity-determining residues of the two orthologs superpose
closely, suggesting that small-molecule inhibitors targeted to the central
substrate-binding subsites will bind to each ortholog in similar ways. Second, the
crystal packing arrangement should permit the approach of such inhibitors to their
targets, and there is some (albeit limited) scope for conformational rearrangement
of the C-terminus that might provide access to the cryptic B1 subsite.
These features represent considerable advantages over crystalline hAng and bAng.

Figure 1 Structural overview. (A) Ribbon diagram of the
mAng·SO4 structure. Helices are coloured yellow
and β-strands pink. Shown in ball-and-stick representation are
disulphide bonds (blue) and a sulphate ion (red) bound to the active site.
Elements of secondary structure are labelled, as are the N- and C-terminal
extremities of the Cα chain (residues 3 and 119,
respectively). The disulphide bonds are formed between residues 39 and 91
(top), 26 and 80 (middle) and 57 and 106 (bottom). (B)
Structure-based alignment of hAng, mAng, bAng and RNase A sequences.
Elements of secondary structure are shaded according to the colour scheme of
panel A and labelled below. In the RNase A sequence, residues shown
crystallographically to form the B1 and B2 subsites
are coloured green and blue, respectively, while those that form the
P1 subsite are ringed in red. hAng residue numbers are given
above the sequences and RNase A residue numbers below.
‘&lt;Q’ signifies a pyroglutamate residue.

Figure 2 P1 subsite. Shown are mFo OMIT
electron density maps contoured at 1σ for the

Residues involved in anion coordination are labelled and highlighted with
color according to the following scheme: mAng carbon, gold; hAng carbon,
gray; nitrogen, blue; oxygen, red. The P1 subsite of
mAng·PO4 is occupied by phosphate ions in two
orientations, A (purple) and B (green); adjacent, orientation-specific water
molecules are colored likewise. Bound anions in the
mAng·SO4 and hAng·PO4 structures
are colored orange and purple, respectively. The side chain of Arg5 is
omitted for clarity.
