Corticosteroids, HGF and EGF play important roles in hepatic biology. We have previously shown that these molecules are required for formation of tissue with specific histology in complex organoid cultures. Dexamethasone suppresses growth and induces hepatocyte maturation; HGF and EGF are needed for formation of the non-epithelial elements. All three are needed for formation of the biliary epithelium. The gene expression patterns by which corticosteroids, HGF and EGF mediate their effects in hepatic tissue formation are distinct. These patterns affect many gene families and are described in detail. In terms of main findings, Dexamethasone induces expression of both HNF4 and C/EBP-alpha, essential transcription factors for hepatocyte differentiation. It suppresses hepatocyte growth by suppressing many molecules associated with growth in liver and other tissues, including IL6, CXC-Chemokine receptor, Amphiregulin, COX-2, HIF, etc. HGF and EGF induce all members of the TGF-beta family. They also induced multiple CNS-related genes, probably associated with stellate cells. Dexamethasone, as well as HGF and EGF, induce expression of HNF6-beta, associated with biliary epithelium formation. Combined addition of all three molecules is associated with mature histology in which hepatocyte and biliary lineages are separate and HNF4 is expressed only in hepatocyte nuclei. In conclusion, the results provide new and often surprising information on the gene expression alterations by which corticosteroids, HGF and EGF exert their effects on formation of hepatic tissue. The results underscore the usefulness of the organoid cultures for generating information on histogenesis which cannot be obtained by other culture or whole animal models.

Introduction

Hepatocytes isolated by perfusion of rat liver with collagenase contain a small contaminant population of other hepatic cells, such as stellate cells, biliary epithelium, endothelial cells, etc. The primary isolates reorganize to form tissue with recognizable, albeit altered, hepatic micro-architecture in roller bottle cultures under the influence of insulin, nicotinamide, corticosteroids (Dexamethasone), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and epidermal growth factor EGF. Histology in these organoid cultures consists of a surface layer of mature biliary epithelium, an intermediate layer of hepatocytes and stellate cells and a layer of endothelial cells attached to the substratum 46. Biliary epithelium in the surface of these cultures is in large part derived from hepatocytes undergoing trans-differentiation 45. HGF and EGF are required for the formation of the biliary epithelium and the connective tissue. The effects on connective tissue are probably mediated by regulation of expression of TGF-beta family members 46. Dexamethasone, in the absence of HGF and EGF, induces maturation of cells exclusively towards the hepatocytic lineage. Biliary epithelium is absent without addition of HGF or EGF. When Dexamethasone, HGF and EGF are all removed, immature hepatocytes present in the cultures undergo intensive proliferation. The reproducibility of histologic alterations induced by addition of specific cytokines provides a useful model for analysis of the mechanisms by which these and other cytokines contribute to the morphogenesis of hepatic tissue. In the current studies, we analyzed the underlying gene expression patterns associated with the morphogenetic changes related to Dexamethasone, HGF and EGF. The results obtained provide unexpected insights as to the pathways involved and the nature of the signaling mediators related to proliferation and maturation of hepatic cellular elements during tissue formation.

Materials and Methods

Animals

Fisher 344 male rats, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Frederick, Maryland, USA. All procedures performed on the rats employed for these studies were approved under the IACUC protocol # 0699068A-1 and conducted according to National Institute of Health guidelines..

Materials

EGF was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical (Waltham, MA). Collagenase for hepatocyte isolation was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Vitrogen (from Celtrix Labs., Palo Alto, CA) was used for collagen coating of roller bottles. General reagents and retrorsine were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). EGF was purchased from Collaborative Biomedical. HGF used for these studies was the Δ5 variant and was kindly donated by Snow Brand Co. (Toshigi, Japan). Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: PCNA from Signet laboratories; Amphiregulin, from NeoMarkers, Inc, Fremont, CA 94539; CXC Chemokine receptor, Research Diagnostic, INC Flanders, NJ 07836; VEGF, VEGF Receptor Flk-1, IGF1, HNF4: From Santa Cruz Biotechnology, INC, Santa Cruz, CA 95060.

Generation and maintenance of organoid cultures

The techniques used to generate the organoid cultures from the livers of the rats were exactly as we recently described 46. Rat hepatocytes were isolated by an adaptation of Seglen’s calcium two-step collagenase perfusion technique 61 as previously described from our laboratory 7. Freshly isolated hepatocytes were added to roller bottles (1450 cm2 pleated surface) obtained from Falcon (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Each bottle contained 210 million freshly isolated hepatocytes in 250 ml of HGM medium supplemented with HGF (40 ng/ml) and EGF (20 ng/m). The bottles were rotated at a rate of 2.5 rotations per minute and kept in an incubator maintained at 37°C, saturated humidity, and 5% CO2. The medium HGM was used to maintain the cultures. The composition of the medium was also as recently described. DMEM liquid medium, HEPES, glutamine, and antibiotics were purchased from GIBCO/BRL (Grand Island, NY). ITS mixture (Insulin, Transferrin, Selenium) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All other additives were cell-culture grade (Sigma). Unless otherwise indicated for specific experiments, the basal HGM consisted of DMEM supplemented with purified bovine albumin (2.0 g/L), glucose (2.25 g/L), galactose (2.0 g/L), ornithine (0.1 g/L), proline (0.030 g/L), nicotinamide (0.305 g/L), ZnCl2 (0.544 mg/L), ZnSO4:7H2O (0.750 mg/L), CuSO4:5H2O (0.20 mg/L), MnSO4 (0.025 mg/L), glutamine (5.0 mmol/L), and dexamethasone (10-7 mol/L). Gentamicin, 50 micrograms per ml, was added to the basal HGM.. The mixed basal HGM was sterilized by filtration through a 0.22-μm low-protein-binding filter system, stored at 4°C, and used within 4 weeks. ITS 1.0 g/L, (rh-insulin 5.0 mg/L, human transferrin 5.0 mg/L, 30% diferric iron saturated], selenium 5.0 μg/L) was added after filtration immediately before use. The growth factors, as required, were added to HGM fresh at the specified concentrations every time the medium was changed. Tissue samples were taken at different times during the cultures to assess histology.

Analysis of Gene Expression: Data generation and Statistics

Affymetrix chip analysis

The Affymetrix oligonucleotide chips specific for the rat (U34 A chip) containing 8000 expressed sequences specific for the rat genome.

cRNA preparation

RNA was isolated from organoid cultures kept in different conditions. The RNA was isolated at Day 20 of the cultures. Three separate culture sets (each from a separate rat) were used to prepare RNA for analysis of gene expression. Total RNA was extracted and purified with Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, San Diego, CA). Five micrograms of total RNA were used in the first strand cDNA synthesis with T7-d(T)24 primer (GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24) by Superscript™ ∥ (GIBCO-BRL, Rockville, MD). The second strand cDNA synthesis was carried out at 16°C by adding E. coli DNA ligase, E. coli DNA polymerase I and RnaseH in the reaction. This was followed by the addition of T4 DNA polymerase to blunt the ends of newly synthesized cDNA. The cDNA was purified through phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation. The purified cDNA were then incubated at 37°C for 4 hours in an in vitro transcription reaction to produce cRNA labeled with biotin using MEGAscript™ system (Ambion, Inc, Austin, TX).

Affymetrix chip hybridization

Fifteen to 20 μg of cRNA were fragmented by incubating in a buffer containing 200 mM Tris-acetate, pH 8.1, 500 mM KOAc, 150 mM MgOAc at 95°C for 35 minutes. The fragmented cRNA were then hybridized with a pre-equilibrated Affymetrix chip at 45°C for 14-16 hours. After the hybridization cocktails were removed, the chips were then washed in a fluidic station with low-stringency buffer (6× SSPE, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.005% antifoam) for 10 cycles (2 mixes/cycle) and stringent buffer (100 mM MES, 0.1 M NaCl and 0.01% Tween 20) for 4 cycles (15 mixes/cycle), and stained with SAPE (Strepto-avidin Phycoerythrin). This was followed by incubation with biotinylated mouse anti-avidin antibody, and restained with SAPE. The chips were scanned in a HP ChipScanner (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA) to detect hybridization signals.

Analysis

The analysis was conducted through an Affymetrix microarray suite 5.0 software. Data were exported and tabulated on Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Office). The mean and standard error of the logarithm (base 2) of the data were expressed. Three totally separate preparations, each from a separate rat, and each used for the four experimental categories analyzed, were used for the studies. Means and standard error from each category of the three data sets (Control, Dexamethasone, HGF+EGF, and combined [Dexamethasone +HGF+EGF] were derived. In addition, the p-value of the difference between the mean of the Control cultures and the mean of the specially treated cultures was determined for each gene. Only genes in which the difference between the Control and the treated category was less than 0.05 were used for the generation of the data presented.

Results

Effects of Dexamethasone, HGF and EGF on histology of the organoid cultures

These results were as previously described in work from our laboratory 46. Cultures maintained in HGM medium alone (containing insulin and nicotinamide) exhibit a high rate of spontaneous proliferation (Fig. 1A). Mitoses are readily observed. The PCNA labeling index is 94% and the percent of nuclei labeled by Ki-67 is 24%. The cells have the appearance of small hepatocytes. No biliary epithelial cells are seen. Staining for HNF4 shows that only 27% percent of nuclei stain strongly positive for this transcription factor (Fig. 1B). There is very little connective tissue. Addition of Dexamethasone induces an increase in the size of the cells, which are now recognized as mature hepatocytes (Fig. 1C). Several apoptotic hepatocytes are also noted. There is a dramatic decrease in cell proliferation (PCNA 39.7% and Ki-67 1%). Mitotic index is 0, whereas in the control cultures it is very high, at 2.3%. More than 95% of the nuclei stain strongly positive for HNF4 (Fig. 1D). No connective tissue or biliary epithelium is seen. Addition of HGF and EGF in the medium alters the histology of the organoid cultures (Fig. 1E). The cells have an appearance most resembling “oval cells” as described in livers of rats subjected to a variety of protocols causing liver regeneration and suppression of hepatocyte proliferation 2,18. There is no clear distinction between surface biliary epithelium and hepatocytes. Staining for HNF4 shows that 18% of the nuclei contain this transcription factor (Fig. 1F). Percent of nuclei labeled with PCNA is more than 90% and percent labeled with Ki-67 is 16%. Combined addition of Dexamethasone, HGF and EGF results in separation of hepatocytic and biliary lineages, with biliary epithelium appearing on the surface of the organoid cultures (Fig. 1G). Cytokeratin 19 is seen only on the surface biliary epithelium 46. HNF4 is only observed in nuclei of hepatocytes, most of which (more than 80%) contain the transcription factor (Fig. 1H). PCNA labeling index is more than 70%. Ki-67 labeling for hepatocytes is less than 5%, whereas more than 60% of the biliary epithelium stained positive for Ki-67, as previously described 46.

Gene expression patterns induced by Dexamethasone

Expression of genes following addition of Dexamethasone was examined in three separate organoid cultures prepared from three different liver perfusions. The results show that Dexamethasone suppresses growth of hepatic cells and promotes hepatocyte differentiation by affecting expression of many signaling molecules and signal transduction pathways. Table 1 is a list of the genes affected and the fold increase or suppression induced by Dexamethasone. Most of the genes affected are associated with previous literature as growth or differentiation regulators in liver or other related tissues. Of the group of genes whose expression change was statistically significant (p value &lt;0.05), only the most dramatically affected genes will be discussed below. The numbers in parenthesis next to each gene indicate the degree or gene expression in Dexamethasone-treated cultures as percent of gene expression in control cultures not treated with Dexamethasone, HGF or EGF.

I. Genes suppressed by Dexamethasone

A. Growth Factors, and related Cytokines and Receptors

Interleukin 6 (IL6) (2.48% of Control) is the most suppressed of the signaling molecules. Many recent studies have shown that IL6 is a mitogen for bile duct epithelial cells and that it regulates expression of STAT3 at the early stages of liver regeneration. Mice with homozygous deletion of IL6 gene have altered liver regeneration response 11,59. Angiopoietin-2 (2.60% of Control) is involved with angiogenesis in liver and other tissues 56. Neuropilin 1, VEGF and its receptor Flk-1 are also molecules involved in angiogenesis and all are suppressed by Dexamethasone 39. This may be due to the fact that Dexamethasone also suppresses the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) (11.94% of Control), a transcription factor known to be expressed in many cells including hepatocytes 34 involved in coordinate induction of gene expression of many angiogenesis related growth factors and their receptors. Pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) (3.05 %) is a member of a family of proteins comprising a group of small secretory proteins, which can function as acute phase reactants, lectins, antiapoptotic factors or growth factors 8. It is expressed highly in hepatocellular carcinomas. Schwannoma-derived growth factor is also known as Amphiregulin (6.7% of Control). . It is a ligand for the EGF receptor.[Normanno, 2001 #6971] There is no literature for any role of Amphiregulin in liver development or regeneration. Of interest, Dexamethasone, while suppressing Amphiregulin, increases gene expression of another EGF receptor ligand, TGFa, though only by 57% (Table 1). The chemokine stroma-derived factor (SDF)-1, and its receptor, CXCR-4, (8.84%) have been shown to be essential for the translocation of hemopoietic stem cells from the fetal liver to the bone marrow 62. The receptor frizzled (10.39% of Control) is associated with signal transduction via beta-catenin, which is involved in growth signaling during liver regeneration 48,49. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown the importance of uPAR (urokinase receptor) (20.31% of Control) in generating growth signals at the earliest stages of liver regeneration 44. Work from several laboratories has implicated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (11.40%) as a growth regulator for neoplasms from many endodermal tissues including colon and pancreas 65.

B. Matrix related proteins and proteases

Addition of Dexamethasone was associated with lack of connective tissue formation in the cultures. The gene expression data correlate very well with this histologic finding. TGFb1, a cytokine associated with fibrosis and induction of many matrix related proteins in several tissues 30, was suppressed by Dexamethasone (16.49% of control). Suppressed were also the genes for osteopontin (1.13%) macrophage metalloelastase (2.16%), dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (decorin) (2.42%), versican (4.42%), lumican (11.94%), collagen type I (14.69%) and collagen type III (18.51%), and tenascin (30.78%).

II. Genes induced by Dexamethasone: Correlation with hepatocyte differentiation

Addition of Dexamethasone causes increase in size and appearance of histologically mature hepatocytes in the organoid cultures (Figure 1C.). These findings correlate well with the data from gene expression analysis in the Dexamethasone treated cultures. A wide range of enzymes and secretory proteins characteristic of hepatocyte differentiation become induced (Table 1). These include metabolic enzymes characteristic of hepatocytes,, such as argininosuccinate synthetase, different species of cytochrome P450 family of proteins, tyrosine aminotransferase, glucokinase and HMG-CoA reductase. Many secretory proteins made by hepatocytes are also included, such vitronectin, thrombin, ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, apolipoprotein C-III, fetuin, hemopexin, alpha-fetoprotein, etc. The changes seen are consistent with the effects of Dexamethasone on hepatocyte associated transcription factors. HNF4 gene expression increases by 527.8%. All (100%) of hepatocyte nuclei stain positive for HNF4 after addition of Dexamethasone (Control: 27%). Increases are also seen in expression of HNF3a (400%), C/EBPα (356%), HNF-6β (350%), HNF3 gamma (235%), and retinoid X receptor (RXR) (296%). Most of the genes associated with hepatocyte differentiation which are induced by Dexamethasone are also controlled by HNF4 and/or C/EBPα 28.

Effects of HGF and EGF

Histologic effects

Addition of HGF and EGF together to control cultures causes a slight decrease in the rate of cell proliferation (KI-67: Control, 24%; HGF+EGF: 16%) and alters the morphology of the cells (Fig. 1 C). There is no clear distinction between hepatocytes and biliary epithelium, with most cells having mixed hepatobiliary features, best resembling the “oval” hepatocytes described in rat liver protocols 17. The epithelial cells are interlaced with other cells types with mesenchymal features. HNF4 staining was seen in only 18% of the nuclei.

Gene expression patterns induced by addition of HGF and EGF combined

Whereas the gene expression patterns induced by Dexamethasone can be easier categorized, the patterns induced by addition of the two tyrosine kinase receptor ligands are more subtle, yet not less dramatic for some of the affected genes. Meaningful changes were seen in expression of growth regulatory molecules, matrix related proteins and transcription factors.

I. Expression of genes related to growth factors and signaling cytokines

Results in this category are shown in Table 2. A variety of genes in this category were suppressed by adding HGF and EGF. Most suppressed was the expression of interleukin 2 and angiopoietin 2. Previous studies have shown expression of angiopoietin 2 in hepatocellular carcinomas and during liver regeneration 13. IL2 however is considered to be expressed primarily in lymphoid cells, though a recent article suggested production of IL2 by hepatocytes 38. Members of the Gro family of pro-inflammatory cytokines are expressed in many cell types including hepatocytes 57. Profoundly suppressed was also the expression of IGF1 as well as receptors for FGF1, parathyroid hormone-like peptide, oxytocin, endothelin, CXC chemokines, VEGF and hyaluronan (motility receptor) and the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor. Amphiregulin was also suppressed, though not as much as with Dexamethasone. TGFa expression to the contrary was increased, more so than with Dexamethasone. Prominent increases in gene expression were seen for several genes in this category. IGF BP1, a known immediate early gene whose expression dramatically increases after partial hepatectomy 42, was most prominently induced. A large group of genes composed ligands and receptors associated with G proteins was also prominently increased. This category included secretin and its receptor, angiotensinogen, olfactory receptors, cannabinoid receptors, etc. There was prominent induction of TGF beta 3 and a mild incduction of TGF beta 1 and 2. There was also marked increase in the expression of Notch,. The latter is generally considered to be an inhibitor of terminal differentiation in multiple systems 21,53 and was increased (459.48%). This is meaningful in view of the histologic evidence that addition of HGF and EGF is associated with cells with intermediate hepatobiliary morphologic characteristics analogous to oval cells. Expression of HGF itself was also induced (282%), as wells as expression of HER-2 neu (229%).

II. Expression of genes associated with hepatic cell differentiation

The observed patterns of increase in specific genes well correlate with the observed histologic changes. Correlating with the fact that HGF and EGF induce appearance of cells resembling oval cells, most prominently increased gene expression was that of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a well known marker of oval cells from whole animal models 64. AFP increased by 1269%. Oval cells are also known for expression of several biliary markers. This also correlates with the marked increase in cytokeratin 19 (592%) and DPP IV (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) (481%). Also noted was an increase in arachidonic acid epoxygenase correlating with observed increase in prostaglandins induced by HGF in several systems 74. Increases were also seen in expression of plasminogen (400%) and iNOS (481%). There was a surprising increase in genes associated with the central nervous system. Many such genes were noted, listed in Table 2. Expression of some of these factors was so far only seen in CNS development (e.g. transcription factors Pax-6, associated with induction of the eye structures 22, and Pit-1 associated with pituitary development) 52. Some of these proteins are associated with cell structure (e.g. synuclein 5) or with peripheral nerves (myelin, neurofibromatosis protein). Other proteins are associated with synaptic formation, such as homer-1c 3 and neurexin III 58. There is emerging literature about convergent gene expression patterns between stellate cells of the liver and astrocytes 9. The observed changes in these cultures may reflect enhanced proliferation and/or differentiation of stellate cells induced by HGF and EGF. This would correlate with the observed increase in connective tissue induced by addition of HGF and EGF, including enhanced expression of collagen type IV and TGFbeta1 shown in our previous publication describing this system 46. Increased numbers of stellate cells would also correlate with the enhanced expression of TGFbeta and HGF, known to be produced by stellate cells of the liver 66 67. On the other hand, expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, known common marker of stellate cells and astrocytes, was suppressed (27%). The observed patterns may also reflect enhanced production of peripheral nerve elements related to peripheral ganglia. This may not be the case as expression of synuclein was localized on the hepatobiliary cells not connective tissue cells (data not shown). The expression of several genes decreased after addition of HGF plus EGF. No clear pattern appears to emerge, other than the fact that some of the genes express proteins involved in the metabolism of fatty acids (see Table 2).

III. Transcription factors

Expression of several transcription factors was altered after addition of HGF plus EGF. Notable was the dramatic increase in HNF6 beta (620%) and HNF4 (448%) as well as cyclin D1 (553%). The data from histologic analysis point out to the fact that HGF and EGF are needed for the formation of the biliary monolayer 46. Recent studies have shown that HNF6 is associated with formation of the biliary epithelium 10. The increased expression of the gene under HGF plus EGF well correlates with the histologic observation from our system about the regulation of biliary epithelium appearance under these two growth factors. Also of interest is the enhanced expression of HNF4. Even though HNF4 expression is almost as enhanced as with Dexamethasone, yet the increase in hepatocyte-associated differentiation markers is not seen with HGF and EGF, suggesting that the effects of the corticosteroid receptor are essential for achieving complete maturation of hepatocytes. In addition, enhanced expression of several other transcription factors (cyclin D1, AT-BP1, AT-BP2, REST, cJun and DEAF1) may interfere with HNF4-mediated control of hepatocyte gene expression.

Gene expression patterns induced by HGF or EGF added alone

Either HGF or EGF added alone induced the characteristic histologic changes seen by the addition of the two combined. This is in agreement with our previously published results on the effects of each of the two growth factors on induction of collagen type IV and TGFb1 46. In view of this, it is not surprising that remarkably few differences in gene expression patterns were noted between HGF and EGF (data not shown). All genes were affected in the same direction (up or down regulation) with differences seen being only a matter of degree. E.g. epoxide hydrolase was induced 7 fold over control by HGF but only 1.5 fold by EGF. Similar changes were also see in few cytochrome P450 related genes. All suppressed genes did not show significant differences between the two growth factors or from the combined addition of HGF plus EGF.

Combined addition of Dexamethasone, HGF and EGF

The addition of Dexamethasone and HGF plus EGF brings out the mature histologic phenotype of the organoid cultures, with clear distinction between biliary epithelium and hepatocytes 46. The histology is quite different compared to that seen with addition of either Dexamethasone or combined HGF+EGF alone. The histologic picture is shown in Fig. 1G). The maturity of the differentiated phenotype is underscored by the pattern of distribution of HNF4, shown in Fig. 1H. In the absence of Dexamethasone, a variable percent of the immature epithelial cells stain positive for HNF4 in the nucleus. In cultures exposed to Dexamethasone only, all hepatocytes contain HNF4 but the biliary epithelium is absent. In cultures exposed to Dexamethasone, HGF and EGF, HNF4 is seen in the nuclei of the hepatocytes only, whereas the nuclei of biliary epithelial cells do not stain positive for HNF4.

Despite the fundamental differences in histology, the gene expression patterns in Dexamethasone + HGF+ EGF appear as a compromise between Dexamethasone alone and [HGF+EGF] alone (data no shown). Genes induced by both Dexamethasone and [HGF+EGF] are induced more by the combination. Most other gene expression levels are average between the two conditions. There is a small set of genes however that are uniquely induced by the combination of [Dexamethasone +HGF+EGF] than either Dexamethasone or [HGF+EGF] alone. The glutamate receptor shown as the most elevated gene has already been described as highly expressed in liver and in central nervous system structures 36. The role of this receptor in the liver however is not understood. VEGF-D is the member of the VEGF family produced predominately by mesenchymal cells and has effects on adjacent endothelial cells. Its expression during embryonic development is associated with organ patterning in lung and other tissues 24. There is a large literature on IGF-II expression during fetal development in the liver and expression in neoplasms 55. Adult liver expresses predominantly IGF-I. The CC chemokines receptor has been found in the brain and in lymphoid tissues but also expressed in hepatocytes 50. Angiotensin receptor has been known to be present in the liver. Angiotensin itself has co-mitogenic properties with EGF in rat hepatocytes 29. Neuromedin receptor has not been described in liver, though the ligand has mitogenic effects on rat hepatocytes 26. There is expression of both nerve growth factor and its low affinity receptor in the liver. NGF is produced by hepatocellular carcinomas 35 and is expressed as an early gene after liver reperfusion injury 51. The decrease in expression of c-kit is consistent with low expression of this receptor in the liver and its upregulation during induction of oval cell formation in suppressed hepatic regeneration 20. RXR is expressed in the adult rat liver and there is an extensive literature on its functions.

Discussion

The literature on signals governing the formation of hepatic tissue during embryogenesis and hepatic regeneration is quite extensive. Most of it is characterized by emphasis on unique signals and gene products, with specific single stimuli triggering a large response with linear downstream signaling cascades, culminating in mitogenesis, altered differentiation, etc. 47. The studies presented here show a complex picture of global alterations in gene expression induced by Dexamethasone, HGF and EGF, during the process of formation of organized histology in cultures derived from hepatic cells. Such complex alterations affecting global patterns of gene expression have been recently described for liver neoplasia 40 and early stages of liver regeneration 42. The histology induced by each of the specific signals (Dexamethasone, HGF and EGF and combination of the three) is quite different. The differences in patterns of gene expression correlated with histology allow for dissection of specific gene pathways associated with different aspects of hepatic histogenesis. Some of the effects observed (e.g. induction of HNF4 by Dexamethasone) were only recently described and not fully understood 4. Others (e.g. induction of alpha fetoprotein by HGF and EGF) constitute novel discoveries of linkage between established biomarkers (AFP) and well studied hepatic growth factors (HGF plus EGF). The results obtained allow us to understand how the specific signaling molecules of the study (Dexamethasone, HGF, and EGF) contribute to the observed effects on the histology of the cultures. Since currently available genetic mouse models do not reveal the impact of these molecules on hepatic embryogenesis, and since it is impossible to remove the effect of the substances under study from the mouse embryo without genetic manipulations, the studies offer insights as to how the specific signals contribute to the formation of the hepatic tissue. Below, we will attempt to correlate the observed gene expression changes with the observed histology.

Effects of Dexamethasone

a. Inhibition of growth of primitive (Control culture) hepatocytes

The effects of corticosteroids on hepatocyte DNA synthesis have been described in several publications. This has been shown both in cell culture [Vintermyr, 1989 #6953] and in whole animal, regenerating liver models [Nagy, 2001 #6954]. Dexamethasone inhibits the proliferative response after 2/3 partial hepatectomy and liver mass is restored by hepatocyte hypertrophy [Nagy, 2001 #6954]. The mechanisms leading to this effect are not clear. Our results show effects on multiple families of genes associated with cell growth in general. Surprisingly, none of these genes are known to be mitogenic signaling molecules for the hepatocytes (pancreatitis associated protein, endothelin receptor, CXC chemokine receptor, COX-2), but they have all been associated with regulation of growth in liver or other organs other systems. IL6 itself, the most suppressed gene in that category, has been associated with optimizing STAT3 activation during liver regeneration 11 and with mitogenic effects on biliary epithelial cells. Given the fact that the cells in the control cultures are immature hepatocytes, they may respond differently to IL6 than the mature cells and have a hybrid hepatocyte and biliary response. If IL6 is a direct mitogen for these cells (as with mature biliary epithelium) then the finding of maximal IL6 suppression may explain in part the cessation of growth. Many other molecules suppressed by Dexamethasone are also involved in liver regeneration, such as uPAR 43, FGF receptor 1 32, etc. Of interest, one of the ligands of the mitogenic receptor EGFR (amphiregulin) is suppressed whereas another one (TGFa) is increased. This apparently paradoxical situation suggests different effects of these ligands on the EGF receptor, or, alternatively, that the EGF receptor at that stage of differentiation does not play a mitogenic role. In fact, EGFR expression was increased by Dexamethasone while growth was suppressed. The results point out that Dexamethasone suppresses multiple parallel growth related pathways in a global manner. Given the important role that many of the genes suppressed by Dexamethasone play as growth regulators in liver and other organs, it is highly likely that the growth suppressing effects of Dexamethasone are mediated by suppression of these genes. Independent immunohistochemical evidence for the effects of Dexamethasone on some of these genes is shown in Fig 2.

b. Dexamethasone inhibits formation of non-hepatocyte-derived tissue components

The Dexamethasone-treated cultures have no evidence of connective tissue or growth of endothelial cells (Fig. 1C). Genetic deletion of the corticosteroid receptor in mice reveals no abnormalities in liver histology. Neonate mice die from pulmonary hemorrhage 33. This suggests that in the absence of glucocorticoid receptor, other receptors also bound by corticosteroids (e.g. PXR 37) may play a compensating role in terms of liver development. In or system however, the contributing effects of Dexamethasone are revealed because the ligand is fully eliminated. Dexamethasone globally suppressed both the main form of VEGF and the mitogenic receptor Flk1. It also suppressed neuropilin (a co-receptor for the VEGF receptors 41). Most of these genes are dependent on positive inductive effects by the hypoxia-inducible factor, also suppressed by Dexamethasone. The effects of Dexamethasone on VEGF have been described sporadically for kidney 25 and keratinocytes 23 whereas its effects on liver tissue were not known. The global manner of suppression of angiogenesis is further illustrated by suppression of the gene for vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, whose expression has not been linked to the hypoxia-inducible factor. The lack of connective tissue also correlates with the gene expression patterns. TGFb1, associated with formation of connective tissue and/or fibrosis in many systems including liver, is suppressed by Dexamethasone. Several previous publications have described that Dexamethasone interferes with the effects of TGFb1. The inhibition of expression of TGFb1 by Dexamethasone, however, has not been previously described except in skin wound healing models 19. Many other connective tissue related genes were also suppressed, however, and it is not clear whether the effects are mediated by suppression of TGF or directly, via modulation of the expression of the specific genes. Such genes included osteopontin (suppressed to 1.13% of control!), dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, versican, lumican, decorin, collagens type I and III, tenascin, fibronectin-1 osteonectin, etc. There was an increase, however, for fibronectin-2 and brevican. The increase in vitronectin was expected since for hepatocytes vitronectin is a secreted protein and differentiation marker.

c. Dexamethasone induces phenotypic maturation of hepatocytes

Induction of differentiation of the primitive hepatocytes to mature cells is apparent by simple histologic examination. Given the often observed association between differentiation and inhibition of growth, this is not surprising. Multiple publications from early literature on hepatocyte cultures document individual gene inductions by Dexamethasone. The global effects of Dexamethasone on hepatocyte maturation however, observed in this system, have not been previously described, except for a recent publication pointing out the acquisition of the hepatocyte phenotype by pancreatic cell lines after exposure to Dexamethasone 70. Key to this global effect of Dexamethasone on hepatocyte maturation must be the combined induction of HNF4 (527% increase) and C/EBP α (356%). HNF4, originally described by Darnell et al. 68 is associated with expression of most of the genes associated with hepatocyte differentiation. It appears very early in embryogenesis 15. The mechanisms regulating expression of HNF4 are not clearly understood. Recently, a glucocorticoid responsive enhancer element 6 kb upstream of the mouse HNF4 promoter was described. Many response elements to other transcription factors were also found in the same region 4. Other than that reference, there is no information relating expression of HNF4 to corticoids. In addition to HNF4, there was also induction of other liver enriched transcription factors such as HNF3b and gamma and HNF6b, as well retinoid X receptor (RXR). Striking was also the induction of C/EBPa, another transcription factor associated with expression of most of the hepatocyte-associated genes. Numerous studies have connected this transcription factor alone or as a ratio between C/EBP a to b, as controlling hepatocyte differentiation 69. Studies from this laboratory have shown that decrease in C/EBPa is associated with dramatic decrease in differentiation in proliferating hepatocytes in monolayer culture and that matrix addition restored differentiation of hepatocytes along with reappearance of C/EBPa and increase of HNF4 in the nucleus 7. Previous studies have also shown that Dexamethasone induces enhanced expression of C/EBPa in hepatoma cells 12 and adipocytes 27. The combined induction of HNF4 and C/EBPa by Dexamethasone is a powerful differentiation signal for restoration of hepatocyte differentiation.

Effects of HGF+EGF in hepatic tissue formation

The role of these growth factors in hepatic tissue development has remained enigmatic. Studies with mice bearing homozygous deletion mutants for HGF 60,71 or its receptor, c-Met 14 have shown that these mutations are lethal for the embryo. Abnormalities in placental development and liver development have been cited as the cause. Yet the cited references do not provide any detail as to the nature of the hepatic abnormalities or whether these changes are secondary to the abnormalities in placental development. Histologic descriptions of the fetal livers in these strains of mice describe only smaller than normal hepatocytes. There is no reference to the hepatic histology at the time of the embryonic death. Mice with homozygous deletions for HGF were rescued by direct (in the embryo) HGF injections 72. They died shortly after birth due to abnormalities of formation of the muscle of the diaphragm. Mice with homozygous deletions of the EGF receptor who survive birth have no hepatic abnormalities 63. Even though EGF receptor is present ubiquitously in most epithelial cells, it is felt that the effects of the absence of the EGF receptor are well compensated by other receptors with overlapping function such as Her2 Neu etc. Thus, studies with “knockout” mice cannot be used to meaningfully investigate the effects of either HGF or EGF on hepatic tissue formation. Our studies with organoid cultures show that HGF and EGF are essential in three endpoints of hepatic histology. These are as follows:

a. Formation of connective tissue and stromal elements

We showed in our previous study with this system that HGF and EGF, alone or together, induce expression of the gene for Collagen type IV, probably through TGFb1. The current studies show that HGF+EGF caused an increase in all TGFb isoforms (1, 2, and 3). Each of these TGFb isoforms is expressed in different tissues and they have been associated with mesenchymal development in most organs 54. Mice with homozygous deletions for the smad family of proteins (TGFb signal transduction pathway) have abnormalities in hepatic development 73. In addition to their effects on induction of TGFb family members, HGF+EGF cause an increase in gene expression in many genes associated in the liver with stellate cells. Many of these genes are also found in brain astrocytes (see below). HGF gene expression itself, a product of stellate cells, also increases. These findings suggest that HGF+EGF, directly or indirectly, increase the numbers and/or enhance the functions of the stellate cells, which are known to be the source for most of the connective tissue proteins in hepatic tissue. HGF and/or EGF appear to have a regulatory function in stellate cell maturation and gene expression, thus affecting formation of the connective tissue seen in these cultures.

b. Appearance of cells with mixed (hepatobiliary, “oval cell”) phenotype

The histology of the cultures demonstrates that the epithelial cells do not have mature features of either hepatocytes or biliary epithelium. However, cytokeratin 19 is expressed on the surface. The cells, morphologically, are most similar in properties to the “oval cells”, with mixed hepatocytic and biliary differentiation, described in the rodent carcinogenesis models 6. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is used as the typical marker for oval cells 6. AFP was very highly induced in the HGF+EGF cultures 13 fold induction!). There was also increase in expression of Notch (4.6 fold increase). As mentioned above, enhanced expression of Notch is typically associated with inhibition of terminal differentiation in most systems. This finding would correlate with the observed mixed hepatobiliary” phenotype, seen in the HGF+EGF cultures.

c. Formation of the biliary epithelium

We have shown in previous studies that HGF induced a ductular phenotype in hepatocytes maintained in collagen gels 7. Other studies have shown that HGF is a mitogen for biliary epithelium 31. In our studies we found that biliary epithelium is derived primarily from phenotypic transformation of the hepatocytes 45. In embryology, biliary epithelium arises from phenotypic transformation of the hepatoblasts abutting the portal nodes, rich in collagen 1 protein. There has been no demonstrated role for any growth factors has been shown in this process. In our previous studies with organoid cultures, we showed that in the absence of HGF and EGF there is no superficial expression of cytokeratin 19, a hallmark of biliary differentiation. In these studies we find that in addition to cytokeratin 19, other markers of biliary epithelium are also induced in the HGF+EGF cultures, such as Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), cytokeratin 8, and keratin 14. Of interest, HGF + EGF also caused a 6.2 fold increase in expression of HNF6 beta, a transcription factor already associated with formation of the biliary system in mice 10. In terms of formation of the biliary epithelium, however, HGF+EGF alone are not sufficient. Dexamethasone, added to HGF+EGF, induces the final maturation of the hepatocytic and biliary lineage and was associated with the appearance of both hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, as well as the selective expression of HNF4 on the nucleus of the hepatocytes. It should be noted that Dexamethasone as well as HGF+EGF independently induce HNF6 beta (see Tables 1 and 2). The histology induced by combined addition of Dexamethasone and HGF+EGF suggests that transcription factors and gene expression patterns induced or activated by Dexamethasone and HGF+EGF are required for the mature biliary phenotype to emerge. Notch gene expression, induced 4.6 fold in the HGF+EGF cultures, decreases to 3.6 fold induction when Dexamethasone is added to HGF+EGF. It is not clear however whether this small decrease would be sufficient to account for the observed marked separation of the differentiated phenotype between hepatocytes and biliary epithelium in the combined [Dex+HGF+EGF] cultures.)

d. expression of genes associated with the central nervous system

A large array of genes commonly associated with cells of the central nervous system was found induced by addition of HGF+EGF (see Results, above). The meaning of this is not clear. Some of these genes, e.g. synuclein (6.6 fold increase) are not found in adult liver 1. Others, such as Pax-6, known as the eye transcription factor, are also expressed in pancreatic islets and have been found in models of trans-differentiation of hepatic progenitor cells into pancreatic islet cells 75. Most of the other genes from this group found expressed have not been described in liver. On the other hand, many recent studies have demonstrated that stellate cells of the liver express many proteins found in brain astrocytes. The total number of the proteins common to both stellate cells and astrocytes has not been fully tabulated and it is conceivable that the unexpected gene expression pattern of CNS genes in liver reflects positive trophic effects of HGF and EGF on stellate cell development. Other literature has also described neurotrophic effects of HGF, during brain development and on motor neurons of the spinal cord 16. The CNS gene expression pattern seen may reflect neurotrophic effects of HGF in susceptible cells derived from the liver, under the culture conditions. It should be emphasized that no cells with features of neuronal or glial cell type are seen in these cultures under any conditions.

Overall, the results demonstrate that hepatic histology that incorporates all the mature cells seen in liver is tightly regulated in part by corticosteroids and the receptor tyrosine kinase ligands HGF and EGF. These cytokines have been shown to play a role in liver regeneration as well. The model allows for other cytokines to be similarly investigated and derive information on the mechanisms controlling formation of hepatic tissue.
