Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) couples the leptin and insulin signalling pathways via IRS-1 and IRS-2. Hence, defective activation of PI3K could be a novel mechanism of peripheral leptin or insulin resistance. We investigated association of tagging SNPs (tSNPs) in the PI3K p85α regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1 with anthropometry, leptin, body fat and insulin sensitivity in a female twin population of European extraction.

Methods
Eight tSNPs were genotyped in 2778 women (mean age 47.4±12.5 years) from the St Thomas’ UK Adult Twin Registry (Twins UK).

Results
SNP rs1550805 was associated with serum leptin (P=0.028), BMI (P=0.025), weight (P=0.019), total fat (P=0.004), % total fat (P=0.002), waist (P=0.025), central fat (P=0.005) and % central fat (P=0.005). SNPs rs7713645 and rs7709243 were associated with BMI (P=0.020; P=0.029), rs7709243 with weight, total and central fat, (P=0.026; P=0.031; P=0.023) and both SNPs with fasting glucose (P=0.003; P=0.001) and glucose 2h post OGTT (P=0.023; P=0.007). Haplotype 222 (freq. 7.2%) showed higher serum leptin (P=0.007) and body fat measures (Ps≤0.001) and haplotype 221 (freq. 38.7%) showed higher fasting and 2h-glucose (P=0.035; P=0.021), compared with the most common haplotype 111 (freq. 45.5%).

Conclusions/interpretation
Association of the PIK3R1 SNP rs1550805 with serum leptin and body fat may reflect diminished ability of PI3K to signal via IRS-1 or IRS-2 in response to leptin.

   Introduction
In the hypothalamus, insulin and leptin function as afferent adiposity signals, important for the regulation of body fat stores and glucose metabolism [1]. Insulin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, whose intrinsic kinase activity phosphorylates insulin receptor substrates IRS-1 and IRS-2. Binding of activated IRS-1 and -2 to the p85 α regulatory subunit of phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) then leads to association with the p110 catalytic subunit and activation of downstream targets via protein kinase B (PKB) [2]. Binding of leptin to hypothalamic receptors inducing tyrosine-phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3, is paralleled by a comparable increase in PI3K activity associated with IRS-2 [3] and to a lesser extent with IRS-1 [4–6]. Hence IRS-1 and IRS-2 represent convergence points in the two hypothalamic signalling pathways and cross-talk could explain the overlapping activities of these two hormones [3].

Overweight individuals have high circulating levels of leptin, implying central resistance to its effect as an adiposity factor [7]. It has been established that pharmacological inhibition of PI3K activity in the hypothalamus inhibits the effects of leptin on food intake [3, 8], suggesting that defective activation of hypothalamic PI3K may play a role in central leptin resistance. Recently, leptin has been shown to increase PI3K activity in liver, leading to lowering of hepatic triglyceride levels in lean rats, but not in obese animals on a high-fat diet [9]. Hence, defective activation of PI3K could also be a novel mechanism of peripheral leptin resistance. Direct interaction between PI3K and membrane vesicles leads to mobilisation of GLUT4 glucose transporters in response to insulin stimulation in adipose, muscle and liver cells [10], so it is possible that defective PI3K activity may also contribute to peripheral insulin resistance.

PI3K regulatory subunit isoforms p8αa, p55α and p50α generated from the same PIK3R1 gene by alternative splicing [11] negatively modulate catalytic activity to different extents [12], with the strongest effect shown by p85α [13]. The p85α protein includes two SH2 domains, which bind to specific phosphotyrosines of IRS-1 and IRS-2 [14] and are preserved in the p55α and p50α variants [15]. Three amino acid substitutions have been identified in PIK3R1, Met326Ile (rs3730089) [16], Arg409Gln in one insulin-resistant subject [17] and an unvalidated SNP Ala440Asp (rs3730091). The first was associated with alterations in glucose/insulin homeostasis in one study [16] but not in a larger sample [18]. One other study [19] found an association between intronic SNP IVS4+82 and type 2 diabetes.

Aside from Met326Ile and IVS4+82, there are no other studies of association of PIK3R1 variants with variables characterizing action of leptin or insulin. Rather than focusing on one or two functional SNPs, which are often difficult to replicate, examination on a gene-wide level is preferable, with common variants within a candidate gene considered jointly through selection of a minimal set of tagging SNPs (tSNPs) [20]. These effectively capture information of the common variants, by taking into account patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across the gene [21, 22]. We selected a set of 8 tSNPs in PIK3R1 and tested their association with a range of variables characterising leptin, body fat and insulin sensitivity in a large female twin population (n=2778; mean age 47.4±12.5 years), approximately double the size of the larger study of Hansen et al. [18]. SNPs were tested individually and as haplotypes.

Subjects and methods
Study design
The Twins UK Registry comprises unselected, mostly female volunteers ascertained from the general population through national media campaigns in the UK [23]. The study cohort included 2778 subjects (423 MZ pairs, 940 DZ pairs, and 52 singletons) with available leptin data. No difference was observed in the distributions of age and menopausal status between subjects with and without leptin data (n=362). The number of individuals in the study cohort with data on other phenotypic variables is shown in Table 1.

Means and ranges of quantitative phenotypes in Twins UK are similar to an age-matched sample of the UK female population [24]. Informed consent was obtained from participants before they entered the study and approved by the local research ethics committee.

Zygosity, body composition and biochemical analyses
Zygosity was determined by standardised questionnaire and confirmed by DNA fingerprinting. Height was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer. Weight (light clothing only) was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using digital scales. BMI was used as a measure of general adiposity and calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2). Waist circumference (cm) was measured at the level midway between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest. Body composition was measured by dual emission X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic QDR-2000, Vertec, Waltham, MA, USA). Serum leptin concentration was determined after an overnight fast using a radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St Louis, MO, USA). Fasting insulin was measured by immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories Ltd., Maidenhead, UK) and glucose was measured on an Ektachem 700 multichannel analyser using an enzymatic colorimetric slide assay (Johnson and Johnson Clinical Diagnostic Systems, Amersham, UK). A sub-sample of approximately 739 subjects, representing unselected female twins from the general population, underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for which glucose and insulin levels were measured before and 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load.

Genotyping for SNP validation and tSNP selection
We used the NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/ and CHIP Bioinformatics http://www.snpperchip.org databases to choose SNPs for validation and tSNP selection in our cohort. Information from the HapMap http://www.hapmap.org for PIK3R1 was not available at the time of SNP selection. Thirteen SNPs validated in the database populations were genotyped in 94 unrelated subjects from the Twins UK cohort for tSNP selection. This sample size is three times that suggested by one permutation study [25], which indicates that genotyping 25–32 unphased individuals is sufficient to select tSNPs. The rs numbers and relative positions of the 13 SNPs are shown in Figure 1.

Genotyping in cohorts
Eight tSNPs (rs706713, rs7713645, rs7709243, rs251406, rs40318, rs1550805, rs831125 and rs3730089) were selected and genotyped in the complete Twins UK cohorts by Pyrosequencing, (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). Genotyping accuracy as assessed by inclusion of duplicates (pairs of MZ twins) in the arrays was 98% and negative controls (water blanks) were included on each plate. Genotyping success rate for each tSNP varied between 77.2% and 93.8%. Primers and PCR conditions for SNP genotyping in the full cohort by Pyrosequencing, are given in online Appendix 2.

Statistical analysis
The main purposes of our analyses were to select a set of tSNPs representing the common variants in PIK3R1 and test the effect of these tSNPs, individually and/or as haplotypes on a range of variables including serum leptin, measures of body fat and insulin sensitivity. We used the htSNP2 program developed by Chapman et al. [21] to identify the optimal subset of tSNPs, which are selected in such a way that the allele frequencies of the remaining (non tSNPs) can be predicted well. A series of regression equations are calculated for which the predictive efficiency is assessed in terms of RL2, which measures the proportion of variance of each remaining SNP “explained” by regression on the tSNP alleles (locus-based scoring). htSNP2 was used to select a tSNP set that predicts remaining SNPs with a minimum RL2 of 0.80 as recommended by Chapman et al.[21]. Pairwise LD coefficients in the tSNP test sample were calculated using GOLD and reported as D′ and r2 [26].

Preliminary association analyses were performed using STATA 8 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Phenotypes significantly (P&lt;0.05) deviating from normal were log transformed to obtain normal distributions prior to analysis. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested by χ2 test with 1 df in one twin of each pair chosen at random to prevent inflated significance. Association analyses were performed using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) [27], which allows for the relatedness between twins and yields unbiased standard errors and p-values. Analyses were done separately for each of the SNPs and followed up by haplotype analyses. For individual SNP association analyses, we first performed a 2-df overall test of genotypic association. In the presence of a significant association, additive, dominant and recessive models (all 1-df) were further tested to find the best mode of inheritance. Age and menopausal status were included as covariates in the models. Details of our approach to test the association of statistically inferred haplotypes with continuous traits have been described previously [28]. In short, we adapted Zaykin et al.’s [29] haplotype trend regression (HTR) for the analysis of related subjects such as twins by replacing the linear regression with the GEE procedure. Assuming additive effects of the haplotypes on the trait, the HTR tests for the contribution of individual haplotypes. The most frequent haplotype was used as the baseline with which effects of the other haplotype were contrasted. Haplotypes with estimated frequencies below 5% in all the subjects were pooled together and included in the model as one term. The probabilities of haplotype pairs were estimated by PHASE 2.0 software [30]. A diplotype analysis under a co-dominant model was also tested by using a weighted GEE, with the weights being the probability for each possible haplotype pair combination for an individual as estimated by PHASE 2.0. Only the diplotypes with frequency &gt; 5% were considered for the diplotype analyses. Obesity related variables included leptin, weight, BMI, waist, total fat mass, % total fat, central fat mass and % central fat. Factor analysis was used to combine strongly correlated indices of obesity into two measures: one for general obesity (serum leptin, BMI, weight, total fat mass and % total fat) and one for central obesity (waist, central fat mass and % central fat). To reduce the likelihood of identifying false positive associations, we only performed analyses of individual obesity-related variables for those SNPs showing significant results for at least one of the combined scores. We initially used two indices of insulin sensitivity, fasting insulin and SiM. SiM is calculated based on both fasting and 2-h insulin and glucose data [31] and was calculated according to the following formulae: SiM=(0.137*SIB+SIH2)/2, where SiB=108/(fasting insulin*fasting glucose*VD); SiH2=108/(2h insulin*2h glucose*VD) and VD=150ml/kg*body weight. Both fasting insulin (r=0.68) and SiM (r=0.92) are highly correlated with insulin sensitivity (Si) in the normal population. SiM is also a good predictor of diabetes, especially in Caucasians [32]. We subsequently tested fasting and 2h glucose based on a hypothesis that direct stimulation of glucose transporter GLUT4 mobilisation by PI3K [10] could occur independently of metabolic effects initiated via its activation of PKB. The program developed by Purcell et al. [33] was used to calculate the genetic power of the study. It provides automated power analysis for quantitative trait loci association tests in sibships. Assuming a sibling correlation of 0.3, a sample of 840 DZ pairs is adequate to detect a locus effect of 0.5% with 80% power (and α = 0.05). The current study involving 940 DZ pairs and an additional 423 MZ pairs and 52 singletons provided even greater power.

Results
Characteristics of subjects in the Twins UK study sample are shown in Table 1. Among the 13 SNPs chosen from the NCBI database, rs8192679, rs10515070, rs895304 and rs3729981 were not polymorphic in our test sample of 94 subjects. Of the remaining 9 polymorphic SNPs, all except rs3730089 (Met326Ile in exon 6) and rs706713 (Tyr73Tyr in exon 1) were located in non-coding regions and their genotype frequencies were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg proportions. The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) and the pairwise D′ and r2 of these 9 SNPs in 94 subjects are shown in Table 2. All the SNPs had MAFs &gt;0.05 and strong LD was observed among rs706713, rs706714, rs7713645 and rs7709243 (D′&gt;0.8 and Ps&lt;0.05). However, except for rs706713 and rs706714 (r2=0.878), low r2 values were found throughout the gene indicating that in this case, tagging would not increase efficiency. This was confirmed by the result that a total of 8 tSNPs were selected to represent the 9 SNPs by the htSNP2 software with the criterion of RL2 &gt;= 0.80 (Table 2). The 8 tSNPs, rs706713, rs7713645, rs7709243, rs251406, rs40318, rs1550805, rs831125 and rs3730089 were further genotyped in all 2778 subjects of the Twins UK cohort. Online Appendix 3 shows the genotype and allele frequencies of the 8 tSNPs, based on one MZ and both DZ twins genotyped for each pair. None of the loci showed deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium.

To reduce the potential generation of false positive results through multiple testing we first analysed the combined central and general obesity scores. We observed significant associations for three tSNPs in at least one of these combined scores (rs7713645: P= 0.072/0.040; rs7709243: P= 0.033/0.020; rs1550805: P=0.006/0.009 for central/general obesity score). These SNPs explained between 0.22–0.31% and between 0.12–0.25% of the variance in central and general obesity, respectively. Since we did not observe any significant effects of rs251406, rs40318, rs706713, rs831125 and rs3730089 on these combined scores (or on any of the glucose or insulin variables), results for these five tSNPs are not further shown. Association results of the three significant tSNPs with the individual obesity phenotypes are shown in Table 3. Carriers of the minor allele of rs1550805 had significantly higher serum leptin, BMI, weight, total fat, % total fat, waist circumference, central fat and % central fat, based on additive and dominant models. Carriers of the minor allele of rs7709243 had significantly higher BMI, weight, total fat and central fat. Carriers of the minor allele of rs7713645 had significantly higher BMI. Carriage of the minor allele of either rs7713645 or rs7709243 was also associated with significantly higher fasting glucose (0.29% to 0.42% of variance) and glucose 2h post OGTT (0.6% to 0.75% of variance). However, we did not observe any significant effects of these tSNPs on the two insulin sensitivity indices, fasting insulin and SiM. Association results for HOMA, another index of insulin sensitivity based on fasting levels of insulin and glucose, are not shown because they were identical to those for fasting insulin.

The estimated haplotype frequencies of the 8 tSNPs are shown in online Appendix 4. The low LD across this gene resulted in 24 haplotypes with frequency &gt;1% and only 5 of them had frequencies &gt;=5 %. Based on simulations, Lake et al. [34] suggest that haplotype frequencies need to be at least 5% to avoid biased regression parameters. The fact that these 5 haplotypes only cover 50% of the haplotype diversity made the haplotype analysis based on the 8 tSNPs uninformative and difficult to interpret. We decided to focus on the 3 SNPs which were individually associated with phenotypes to clarify the combined effect of these SNPs. Online Appendix 5 shows estimated frequencies of haplotypes constructed by the three SNPs, rs7713645, rs7709243 and rs1550805. Table 4 shows tests of association including the three common (&gt;5%) haplotypes (1-1-1, 2-2-1 and 2-2-2). Haplotype analyses showed results similar to those of the individual SNP associations, with haplotype rs7713645-rs7709243-rs1550805 2-2-2 (freq. 7.2%) showing higher serum leptin (P=0.007) and higher levels of all body fat measures (Ps≤0.001) compared with the most common haplotype 1-1-1 (freq. 45.5%). Haplotype 2-2-1 (freq. 38.7%) showed higher fasting glucose (P=0.035) and 2h glucose (P=0.021) compared with the most common haplotype. SNP rs1550805 had a strong association with obesity variables, whilst the effects on glucose appeared to be associated with rs7713645 and rs7709243. As rs7713645 and rs7709243 showed same alleles among the three most common haplotypes, a more parsimonious haplotype analysis based on one of these two SNPs and rs1550805 was further tested. Results remained unchanged. The 2344 individuals used to reconstruct haplotypes included some subjects with incomplete genotype data. We redid haplotype analyses based on the subjects with data on all 3 SNPs and observed the same results as in the analyses based on subjects with data on at least one SNP (data not shown). Diplotype analyses confirmed the results of haplotype analyses with haplotype 2-2-2 heterozygotes showing higher levels of body fat measures and haplotype 2-2-1 heterozygotes and homozygotes showing higher 2h glucose (online Appendix 6).

The overall significance of haplotype associations with leptin, BMI, waist and all fat measurements was high and the effect size was relatively large. For example, individuals homozygous for haplotype 2-2-2 on average are 5 kg heavier, have 4 cm larger waist circumference and have 1.73 kg.m−2 greater BMI than those homozygous for 1-1-1. However, the percentages of variance in obesity phenotypes explained by PIK3R1 haplotypes only ranged from 0.35% (P=0.003) for % central fat to 0.54% for BMI (P=0.003), which is a reflection of the low frequency of haplotype 2-2-2 (7.2%), but much as expected for a trait influenced by many genes.

Discussion
We have examined association of a set of eight tSNPs spanning the PIK3R1 gene, with a range of phenotypes representing serum leptin, anthropometry, body fat and glucose/insulin homeostasis in a large population of Caucasian British female twins. We showed in single tSNP analyses that one tSNP in particular, rs1550805, was significantly associated with serum leptin, BMI, weight, waist circumference and all the fat variables. tSNPs rs7713645 and rs7709243 were significantly associated with BMI, rs7709243 with weight, total and central fat, and both tSNPs with fasting glucose and glucose 2h post OGTT. Haplotypic analyses of these 3 tSNPs confirmed the significance of the individual associations, with haplotype 2-2-2 showing significantly higher levels of serum leptin and with all body fat measures. Haplotype 2-2-1 was significantly associated with higher levels of fasting glucose and 2h glucose, but the most significant finding is the association of rs1550805 with serum leptin and body fat measurements.

The main strength of our study lies in the large size of the study sample, the availability of detailed measurements of body fat by DEXA in all subjects and comprehensive measurement of variation in the gene. This is the first gene-wide association study of PIK3R1 and the first reported association of variants with leptin and body fat measurements, strengthening the candidature of the gene in susceptibility to obesity and insulin resistance. Assuming a sibling correlation of 0.3, the current study provided power in excess of 80% (and α = 0.05) to detect a locus effect of 0.5% [33]. It should be noted that we have established these associations only in a female twin population, but that our findings in the twin subjects can be considered as representative of the UK female population as a whole [24]. We have previously found few differences between twins and singletons in the population generally, the only indication being that MZ twins had a slightly lower weight and a smaller variance for weight than DZ twins and singletons [24].

The comprehensiveness of coverage of the PIK3R1 gene by our selected tSNPs was limited by the availability of SNPs on public databases at the time of the study. Information from the HapMap http://www.hapmap.org for PIK3R1 has only recently become available. Seven of our eight tSNPs are within the 27 common SNPs (MAF≥5% in CEPH subjects) posted on the current release of HapMap (Phase II, January 2006). Sixteen HapMap SNPs cannot be tagged by our selection. The gene lies in a region of low linkage disequilibrium, shown by low r2 values found throughout the gene, so that eight tSNPs were needed to represent the nine validated SNPs available in public databases at the time. All of our associated tSNPs, with the exception of the Met326Ile variant rs3730089, are intronic and are most likely to be LD markers.

Previously reported investigations of variation in PIK3R1 have centred on tests of association with type 2 diabetes and associated phenotypes [16,18, 35, 36], on account of the well-known involvement of PI3K in insulin signalling in peripheral tissues [37] and the hypothalamus [2]. Relatively little attention has been paid to the influence of PI3K on fat deposition, which could occur through the anti-lipolytic effect of insulin and be influenced by leptin through cross-talk with the insulin-signalling path [2, 38]. Aside from the Met326Ile variant [16] and an IVS4+82 SNP [19], there are to our knowledge no other reported studies of association of other PIK3R1 variants with variables characterizing action of leptin or insulin.

We found no significant associations between any single tSNPs or haplotypes with fasting insulin and the SiM insulin sensitivity measure. Among our tested tSNPs, the Met326Ile variant rs3730089 was previously reported to be associated with insulin sensitivity in 380 young healthy Danish subjects [16]. However, this group failed to replicate the association in a later study of 1190 individuals [18].

In summary, we have established an association between PIK3R1 SNP rs1550805 with serum leptin and a range of body fat measures in a large Caucasian female twin population. Phosphorylation of IRS-2 by JAK2 lies at a convergence point of the leptin and insulin signalling pathways [39]. Leptin potentiates insulin signalling through its activation of IRS-2 by JAK2 phosphorylated at the leptin receptor [40] and activates PI3K in muscle via this IRS-2 dependent pathway [41]. The importance of PI3K signalling via IRS-1 in the lipid-lowering effect of leptin in liver has been shown by Huang et al. [9] and Niswender et al. [3] have shown PI3K and IRS-2 are involved in the anorexic response to leptin in the hypothalamus. We speculate that the site marked by rs1550805 may reflect diminished ability of PI3K to signal via IRS-1 or IRS-2 in response to leptin. This could lead to impaired leptin action, failure of the normal feedback regulation of leptin levels and accumulation of body fat.

PI3K regulatory subunit isoforms p85α, p55α and p50α generated from the same PIK3R1 gene by alternative splicing [11] negatively modulate catalytic activity to different extents [12], with the strongest effect shown by p85α [13]. Future investigations need to focus on a search for potentially functional SNPs in the isoform-specific exons as well as putative regulatory regions in PIK3R1, in view of evidence that the balance and activity of the isoforms affect overall activity of the PI3K enzyme [12, 13, 42, 43].
